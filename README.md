# Greater Manchester Integrated Digital Care Record

All extraction scripts and clinical code sets for projects involving the Greater Manchester Integrated Digital Care Record (GM IDCR).

## Overview

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and more specifically the UK [Control of Patient Information (COPI) notice](https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-response-information-governance-hub/control-of-patient-information-copi-notice), researchers at the University of Manchester have access to the GM IDCR for research purposes. This repository makes available for scrutiny all aspects of the data extraction process.

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found in the [docs](docs/) folder. Specific links to individual files are:

- [High level end to end process for researchers requesting data](docs/process-end-2-end.md)

## Things to check

There are certain things that may exist in the data that would be useful to several research groups. These should be prioritised when initially examining the data.

- Hospital admissions
- HES data
- Mortality data
- COVID-19 specific stuff
  - GP diagnoses
  - 
- National audit data for covid19 - e.g. ICNARC
- Ethnicity

## Process

A team of research data engineers (RDE) will have access to the data. Initially they will attempt to get an understanding of the data available, before extracting the data for specific research projects. A common, documented, approach will be used in order to ensure the quality of the data extract is the same regardless of which RDE is used.
