# Greater Manchester Integrated Digital Care Record

All documentation, extraction scripts and clinical code sets for projects involving the Greater Manchester Care Record (GMCR).

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and more specifically the UK [Control of Patient Information (COPI) notice](https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-response-information-governance-hub/control-of-patient-information-copi-notice), researchers at the University of Manchester have access to the GMCR for research purposes. This repository makes available for scrutiny all aspects of the data extraction process.
