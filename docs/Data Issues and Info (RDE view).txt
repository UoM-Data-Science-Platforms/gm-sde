Data Issues and Info (RDE view)

1. BMI will need to be calculated using GP_events

2. Smoking Status can be inferred from GP_events

3. Dates for covid tests don't seem too reliable

4. Many discrepancies between public records and IDCR testing data from GP record.
 E.G. people from outside GM being tested at airport.

5. Procedure data - only three tenancies (UHSM, Tameside, Pennine) providing any PROC code data.

6. In COVID19 table, small amount of patients with 'Y' for DeathWithin28Days but no DeathDate
