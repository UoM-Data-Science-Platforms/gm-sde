Data Limitations (public view)

1. Acute data is only available from when the feed for each CCG went live.
 This means that historic acute data is not available prior to the feed going live.

2. We do not have data on patients that died before the feed went live.
 The only death data we have is for patients that have died since their data feed went live.

3. Prescribing data is only available for primary care, not secondary care.

4. Covid-19 testing data currently only comes from the GP record, and is not fully representative.
