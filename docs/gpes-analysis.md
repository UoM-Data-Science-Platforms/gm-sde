# GPES analysis and comparison with GMCR

_During COVID-19, the scope of GPES is extended and the data is available for research. Some research questions may
be better answered by this dataset instead of the GMCR, so it is worthwhile examining what GPES can offer._

## GPES

The General Practice Extraction Service ([GPES](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/general-practice-extraction-service))
collects a variety of data from all practices in ?England?. It is collected every 2 weeks. It is collected
for a variety of reasons, one of which is for QOF payments. Some data is anonymised and some is patient identifiable.

**During the COVID-19 pandemic NHS digital have extended the list of SNOMED codes that get extracted from each practice.**

## Notes

- GPES does not extract data from the records of patients who have opted out of sharing data for secondary purposes (type 1 opt out).
  This is the same as the GMCR.
- For COVID-19 research you can obtain the following 3 groups of SNOMED codes (**_see table below for full details_**).
  1. A list of medications
  2. A list of codes that are extracted regardless of when they were recorded in the patient record
  3. A list of codes that are extracted but only if they occurred in the last 2 years
- For each patient you get:
  - NHS number
  - date of birth
  - sex
  - full name
  - address
  - ethnicity
  - date of death (if applicable).
- For each SNOMED code from the relevant groups you get (not sure what all of these mean yet):
  - Dates
  - Record dates
  - Codes
  - Episodes Condition
  - Episodes Prescription
  - Value Condition 1s
  - Value Condition 2s
  - Value Prescription 1
  - Value Prescription 2
