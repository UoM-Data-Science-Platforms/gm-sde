# Research Data Engineer processes

All processes involving a Research Data Engineer (RDE) are explained in more detail here. For a high level overview of the end to end process please see the documentation [here](process-end-2-end.md).

## Overview

An RDE will be assigned to work with the group of researchers who wish to obtain a data extract. The RDE will help determine the precise requirements for the data extract, and, once approved, will extract the data and transfer it to a virtual machine that the researchers will have access to.

## Determining the data to be extracted

The research teams will have differing levels of knowledge of working with routinely collected data. They will also likely not be familiar with the GM IDCR. Therefore the role of the RDE is to help them understand what data is available so they can best determine what should be in their data extract.
