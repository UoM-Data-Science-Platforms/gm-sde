# Propensity score matching

We intend to offer analysts the service of propensity score matching for idenfifying matching cohorts. This is being trialled with a single project and the results will be documented here.

## Process

- Create a file called `propensity-score-matching.template.sql` in the `template-sql` directory of a project
- This contains the code which extracts the data required by the propensity score matching code

**UPDATE 12th May** This is on hold until we get a project that wants to do this.
