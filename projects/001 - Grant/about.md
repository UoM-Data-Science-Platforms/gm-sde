# Healthcare Utilisation Across Greater Manchester During The Covid-19 Pandemic

## Summary

We will use the GMCR to study how the healthcare system in Greater Manchester has been used throughout the pandemic. For example, how busy GP surgeries are, how many routine operations are conducted, and how full the hospitals are. We will study this over the time of the pandemic, and split the analysis according to patients with and without Covid. These analyses will give important insights into bottlenecks in the system that will help with planning for subsequent waves and future pandemics.
