# COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 related hospital admission and death in cancer patients in Greater Manchester (GM): Effect of Comorbidity and Polypharmacy in a population-based study

## Summary

Use of the GM Care Record to determine the risks and factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosis,  hospital admission and death in cancer patients, with hospitalisation and deaths data linked for the first time to longitudinal primary care electronic health records in GM.

We will study this over the time of the pandemic, and split the analysis according to patients with and without cancer, and with and without COVID-19. This work will provide an overall picture of COVID-19 risk in all GM patients with cancer and help inform individual management decisions for cancer patients regarding treatment and need for shielding.
