# COVID â€“ opportunities to improve practice and reduce harm in patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking methotrexate

## Summary

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term inflammatory disease that requires treatment with medications to suppress the immune system, such as Methotrexate.  Patients with RA taking these medications need to attend a rheumatologist or their GP on a regular basis to have monitoring blood tests, to make sure they do not develop side effects.  However, we do not know how frequent this monitoring needs to be as there has been very little research to understand this.  Current guidelines from the British Society of Rheumatology are based on expert opinion, and say these blood tests should occur every 12 weeks once patients have been established on the treatment and are on a stable dose.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of concern about the risks of people meeting face-to-face, in particular coming to hospitals or GP surgeries as they normally would for routine monitoring blood tests.  Therefore the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued rapid guidelines which said that the gap between monitoring blood tests could be increased in patients who are on stable treatment.  However these guidelines did not say what increase was safe.

1. What were the gaps between blood tests for patients with RA taking methotrexate during the COVID-19 pandemic
2. For patients with RA whose interval increased, was this associated with:
	- Abnormal monitored bloods test results
	- Gaps in methotrexate prescriptions leading to (i) more visits to the GP or A&E or (ii) more  steroid tablets given
