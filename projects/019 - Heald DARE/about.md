# The DARE study – relating the genome to COVID-19 related health outcomes for people with diabetes who became infected with COVID-19

## Summary

If specific genetic predisposing factors to severe Coronavirus infection in people with diabetes can be determined, that will enhance the precision of risk profiling and the development of a risk score that will include genomic as well as phenotypic and socio-demographic factors in relation to severe Coronavirus infection.

Such information will be of great help as we look to support those people with diabetes (many of whom have been ‘shielding’ on and off for months already) in our population in the coming months and possibly years.
