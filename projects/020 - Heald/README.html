<h1>Greater Manchester collaborative to evaluate why some people with diabetes have a greater risk of becoming seriously unwell or dying with COVID-19</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our plan is to compare all the people who have diabetes in Greater Manchester and were alive on 1 January 2020, who became seriously ill (on the basis of hospital admission) and/or died with COVID-19, with those with diabetes (also alive on 1 January 2020) who were infected with COVID-19 and did not become seriously unwell, by analysis of their medical history, allergy status, COVID-19 test status, prescribed medication, ethnicity and socio-demographic situation to determine what is different about the people with known diabetes who became seriously ill or died vs those had a mild infection or no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>This work is going to be pivotal to understanding what we must do in the coming months and years to reduce the risks posed by COVID-19 to people with all types of diabetes.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.</li>
<li>A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.</li>
<li>A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.</p>
<h2>Reusable queries</h2>
<p>This project required the following reusable queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patient GP history</li>
<li>Secondary admissions and length of stay</li>
<li>Secondary discharges</li>
<li>COVID vaccinations</li>
<li>Townsend Score (2011)</li>
<li>Lower level super output area</li>
<li>Smoking status</li>
<li>Cohort matching on year of birth / sex / and an index date</li>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Year of birth</li>
<li>Patients with COVID</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details for each query can be found below.</p>
<h3>Patient GP history</h3>
<p>To produce a table showing the start and end dates for each practice the patient has been registered at.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We do not have data on patients who move out of GM, though we do know that it happened. For these patients we record the GPPracticeCode as OutOfArea</li>
<li>Where two adjacent time periods either overlap, or have a gap between them, we assume that the most recent registration is more accurate and adjust the end date of the first time period accordingly. This is an infrequent occurrence.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>No pre-requisites
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>A temp table as follows:
 #PatientGPHistory (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode, StartDate, EndDate)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- GPPracticeCode - national GP practice id system
	- StartDate - date the patient registered at the practice
	- EndDate - date the patient left the practice

<h3>Secondary admissions and length of stay</h3>
<p>To obtain a table with every secondary care admission, along with the acute provider, the date of admission, the date of discharge, and the length of stay.</p>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>One parameter
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>Two temp table as follows:
 #Admissions (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
  (Limited to one admission per person per hospital per day, because if a patient has 2 admissions
   on the same day to the same hopsital then it's most likely data duplication rather than two short
   hospital stays)
 #LengthOfStay (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
	- DischargeDate - date of discharge (YYYY-MM-DD)

<hr>
<h3>COVID vaccinations</h3>
<p>To obtain a table with first, second, third... etc vaccine doses per patient.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>GP records can often be duplicated. The assumption is that if a patient receives two vaccines within 14 days of each other then it is likely that both codes refer to the same vaccine.</li>
<li>The vaccine can appear as a procedure or as a medication. We assume that the presence of either represents a vaccination</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Takes two parameters:
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is &quot;RLS.vw_GP_Events&quot; but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
	- gp-medications-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP medications. Usually is &quot;RLS.vw_GP_Medications&quot; but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode

<hr>
<h3>Lower level super output area</h3>
<p>To get the LSOA for each patient.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple LSOAs we determine the LSOA as follows:</li>
<li>If the patients has an LSOA in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date</li>
<li>If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that</li>
<li>If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that</li>
<li>Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown</li>

<h3>Smoking status</h3>
<p>To get the smoking status for each patient in a cohort.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We take the most recent smoking status in a patient's record to be correct</li>
<li>However, there is likely confusion between the &quot;non smoker&quot; and &quot;never smoked&quot; codes. Especially as sometimes the synonyms for these codes overlap. Therefore, a patient wih a most recent smoking status of &quot;never&quot;, but who has previous smoking codes, would be classed as WorstSmokingStatus=non-trivial-smoker / CurrentSmokingStatus=non-smoker</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)

<h3>Patients with COVID</h3>
<p>To get tables of all patients with a COVID diagnosis in their record. This now includes a table that has reinfections. This uses a 90 day cut-off to rule out patients that get multiple tests for a single infection. This 90 day cut-off is also used in the government COVID dashboard. In the first wave, prior to widespread COVID testing, and prior to the correct clinical codes being	available to clinicians, infections were recorded in a variety of ways. We therefore take the first diagnosis from any code indicative of COVID. However, for subsequent infections we insist on the presence of a positive COVID test (PCR or antigen) as opposed to simply a diagnosis code. This is to avoid the situation where a hospital diagnosis code gets entered into the primary care record several months after the actual infection.</p>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Takes three parameters
  - start-date: string - (YYYY-MM-DD) the date to count diagnoses from. Usually this should be 2020-01-01.
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is &quot;RLS.vw_GP_Events&quot; but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>Three temp tables as follows:
 #CovidPatients (FK_Patient_Link_ID, FirstCovidPositiveDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- FirstCovidPositiveDate - earliest COVID diagnosis
 #CovidPatientsAllDiagnoses (FK_Patient_Link_ID, CovidPositiveDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- CovidPositiveDate - any COVID diagnosis
 #CovidPatientsMultipleDiagnoses
	-	FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	-	FirstCovidPositiveDate - date of first COVID diagnosis
	-	SecondCovidPositiveDate - date of second COVID diagnosis
	-	ThirdCovidPositiveDate - date of third COVID diagnosis
	-	FourthCovidPositiveDate - date of fourth COVID diagnosis
	-	FifthCovidPositiveDate - date of fifth COVID diagnosis

<h3>COVID-19 positive antigen test</h3>
<p>A code that indicates that a person has a positive antigen test for COVID-19.</p>
<h4>COVID positive tests in primary care</h4>
<p>The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets. However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of <code>covid-positive-antigen-test</code>, <code>covid-positive-pcr-test</code> and <code>covid-positive-test-other</code>.</p>

<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range <code>1.19% - 26.55%</code> as of 11th March 2021 is too wide. However the prevalence figure of 26.55% from EMIS is close to public data and is likely ok.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE - 25th March 2021</strong> Missing Read and CTV3 codes were added to the vaccination list and now the range of <code>26.91% - 32.96%</code> seems reasonable. It should be noted that there is an approx 2 week lag between events occurring and them being entered in the record.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE - 12th April 2021</strong>, latest prevalence figures.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE - 18th March 2022</strong> There are now new codes for things like 3rd/4th/booster dose of vaccine. The latest prevalence shows <code>65.0% - 66.3%</code> have at least one vaccine code in the GP_Events table, and <code>88.2% - 93.6%</code> have at least one code for the vaccine in the GP_Medications table.</p>

<h3>Body Mass Index (BMI)</h3>
<p>A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (<code>22K.. - Body Mass Index</code>). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (<code>22K6. - Body mass index less than 20</code>) without giving the actual value.</p>
<p><strong>NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.</strong></p>
<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range <code>63.96% - 79.69%</code> suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes <code>62.48% - 64.93%</code> which suggests that this code set is well defined.</p>

<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range <code>1.04% - 1.77%</code> is perhaps too wide suggesting there is an underreporting from TPP practices - or the CTV3 code set differs from the others.</p>
