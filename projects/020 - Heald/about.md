# Greater Manchester collaborative to evaluate why some people with diabetes have a greater risk of becoming seriously unwell or dying with COVID-19

## Summary

Our plan is to compare all the people who have diabetes in Greater Manchester and were alive on 1 January 2020, who became seriously ill (on the basis of hospital admission) and/or died with COVID-19, with those with diabetes (also alive on 1 January 2020) who were infected with COVID-19 and did not become seriously unwell, by analysis of their medical history, allergy status, COVID-19 test status, prescribed medication, ethnicity and socio-demographic situation to determine what is different about the people with known diabetes who became seriously ill or died vs those had a mild infection or no symptoms at all.

This work is going to be pivotal to understanding what we must do in the coming months and years to reduce the risks posed by COVID-19 to people with all types of diabetes.
