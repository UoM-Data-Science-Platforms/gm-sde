# The equitability of the UK COVID-19 vaccination strategy

## Summary

The government plan for the roll out of the COVID vaccines aims to protect the most vulnerable first, giving priority access to people with the highest risk of hospitalisation or mortality from COVID. We aim to use electronic health data from across Greater Manchester to test whether the government vaccination plan meets the goal of giving equal priority to people with equal vulnerability to COVID.

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Flu vaccine eligibile patients
- Patient received flu vaccine in a given time period
- COVID vaccinations
- COVID-related secondary admissions
- Patients with COVID
- Secondary admissions and length of stay
- Secondary discharges
- Care home status
- Sex
- Lower level super output area
- Year of birth

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Patient received flu vaccine in a given time period
To find patients who received a flu vaccine in a given time period

_Assumptions_

- We look for codes related to the administration of flu vaccines and codes for the vaccine itself

```
Takes three parameters
  - date-from: YYYY-MM-DD - the start date of the time period (inclusive)
  - date-to: YYYY-MM-DD - the end date of the time period (inclusive)
 	- id: string - an id flag to enable multiple temp tables to be created
 Requires one temp table to exist as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientHadFluVaccine{id} (FK_Patient_Link_ID, FluVaccineDate)

---
### COVID vaccinations
To obtain a table with first, second, third... etc vaccine doses per patient.

_Assumptions_

- GP records can often be duplicated. The assumption is that if a patient receives two vaccines within 14 days of each other then it is likely that both codes refer to the same vaccine.
- The vaccine can appear as a procedure or as a medication. We assume that the presence of either represents a vaccination

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #COVIDVaccinations (FK_Patient_Link_ID, VaccineDate, DaysSinceFirstVaccine)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- VaccineDose1Date - date of first vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose2Date - date of second vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose3Date - date of third vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose4Date - date of fourth vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose5Date - date of fifth vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)

---
### Lower level super output area
To get the LSOA for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- If the patients has an LSOA in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:

---
### Year of birth
To get the year of birth for each patient.

- If every YOB for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated YOB in the database then we use that
- Otherwise we take the highest YOB for the patient that is not in the future

## Clinical code sets

This project required the following clinical code sets:

- covid-vaccination v1
- flu-vaccination v1
- flu-vaccine v1
- moderate-clinical-vulnerability v1
- severe-mental-illness v1
- high-clinical-vulnerability v1
- covid-vaccine-declined v1

Further details for each code set can be found below.

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `1.19% - 26.55%` as of 11th March 2021 is too wide. However the prevalence figure of 26.55% from EMIS is close to public data and is likely ok.

**UPDATE - 25th March 2021** Missing Read and CTV3 codes were added to the vaccination list and now the range of `26.91% - 32.96%` seems reasonable. It should be noted that there is an approx 2 week lag between events occurring and them being entered in the record.

**UPDATE - 12th April 2021, latest prevalence figures:

### At moderate risk of complications with COVID-19

These codes were used by system suppliers to indicate whether a patient was at moderate risk of complications if contracting COVID-19.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `0.01% - 1.25%` is too wide so these codes are not sufficiently well recorded in practice. Also the figure of `1.25%` is far lower than the actual figure is expected to be from public data.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |    31107 (1.12%) |     32588 (1.25%) |

### Severe mental illness

Defined as any diagnosis of:

- Psychotic disorder
- Bipolar disorder
- Schizophrenia

or patients on the severe mental illness register.

CTV3 code sets from OpenSafely.

SNOMED code set created from the following codes and all their descendants:

| SNOMED code | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 391193001   | On severe mental illness register (finding) |

| 58214004    | Schizophrenia (disorder)                    |
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `1.04% - 1.77%` is perhaps too wide suggesting there is an underreporting from TPP practices - or the CTV3 code set differs from the others.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |    46405 (1.78%) |     46081 (1.77%) |
| 2021-03-11 | TPP             | 210333     |     2200 (1.05%) |      2196 (1.04%) |
| 2021-03-11 | Vision          | 333251     |     6770 (2.03%) |      5338 (1.60%) |

### At high risk of complications with COVID-19

These codes were used by system suppliers to indicate whether a patient was at high risk of complications if contracting COVID-19. EMIS practices originally used the code "9d44. - Risk of exposure to communicable disease (situation)" until they were able to use the SNOMED codes.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `5.78% - 6.18%` is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined - but only when using the supplied clinical codes.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |   158791 (6.11%) |    160665 (6.18%) |
| 2021-03-11 | TPP             | 210333     |      497 (0.24%) |     12159 (5.78%) |
| 2021-03-11 | Vision          | 333251     |    11469 (3.44%) |     19965 (5.99%) |

### Covid vaccine declined

Any codes indicating the patient has declined the vaccine for COVID-19.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `0.78% - 0.82%` for EMIS and TPP seems plausible. But in comparison the `0.40%` for Vision systems seems on the low side. There may be some extra Read v2 codes we haven't identified.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-25 | EMIS            | 2602984    |     1783 (0.07%) |     21305 (0.82%) |
