# The equitability of the UK COVID-19 vaccination strategy

## Summary

The government plan for the roll out of the COVID vaccines aims to protect the most vulnerable first, giving priority access to people with the highest risk of hospitalisation or mortality from COVID. We aim to use electronic health data from across Greater Manchester to test whether the government vaccination plan meets the goal of giving equal priority to people with equal vulnerability to COVID.

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Flu vaccine eligibile patients
- Patient received flu vaccine in a given time period
- COVID vaccinations
- COVID-related secondary admissions
- Patients with COVID
- Secondary admissions and length of stay
- Secondary discharges
- Care home status
- Sex
- Lower level super output area
- Year of birth

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Patient received flu vaccine in a given time period
To find patients who received a flu vaccine in a given time period

_Assumptions_

- We look for codes related to the administration of flu vaccines and codes for the vaccine itself

  - date-to: YYYY-MM-DD - the end date of the time period (inclusive)
 	- id: string - an id flag to enable multiple temp tables to be created
 Requires one temp table to exist as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientHadFluVaccine{id} (FK_Patient_Link_ID, FluVaccineDate)

### COVID vaccinations
To obtain a table with first, second, third... etc vaccine doses per patient.

_Assumptions_

- GP records can often be duplicated. The assumption is that if a patient receives two vaccines within 14 days of each other then it is likely that both codes refer to the same vaccine.
- The vaccine can appear as a procedure or as a medication. We assume that the presence of either represents a vaccination

_Input_
```
Takes two parameters:
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
	- gp-medications-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP medications. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Medications" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #COVIDVaccinations (FK_Patient_Link_ID, VaccineDate, DaysSinceFirstVaccine)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- VaccineDose1Date - date of first vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose2Date - date of second vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose3Date - date of third vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose4Date - date of fourth vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose5Date - date of fifth vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose6Date - date of sixth vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)
	-	VaccineDose7Date - date of seventh vaccine (YYYY-MM-DD)

### COVID-related secondary admissions
To classify every admission to secondary care based on whether it is a COVID or non-COVID related. A COVID-related admission is classed as an admission within 4 weeks after, or up to 2 weeks before a positive test.

_Input_
```
Takes one parameter
  - start-date: string - (YYYY-MM-DD) the date to count diagnoses from. Usually this should be 2020-01-01.
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
 And assumes there exists two temp tables as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
 #Admissions (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider)
  A distinct list of the admissions for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #COVIDUtilisationAdmissions (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider, CovidHealthcareUtilisation)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
	- CovidHealthcareUtilisation - 'TRUE' if admission within 4 weeks after, or up to 14 days before, a positive test

---
### Patients with COVID
To get tables of all patients with a COVID diagnosis in their record. This now includes a table that has reinfections. This uses a 90 day cut-off to rule out patients that get multiple tests for a single infection. This 90 day cut-off is also used in the government COVID dashboard. In the first wave, prior to widespread COVID testing, and prior to the correct clinical codes being	available to clinicians, infections were recorded in a variety of ways. We therefore take the first diagnosis from any code indicative of COVID. However, for subsequent infections we insist on the presence of a positive COVID test (PCR or antigen) as opposed to simply a diagnosis code. This is to avoid the situation where a hospital diagnosis code gets entered into the primary care record several months after the actual infection.

_Input_
```
Takes three parameters
  - start-date: string - (YYYY-MM-DD) the date to count diagnoses from. Usually this should be 2020-01-01.
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
```

_Output_
```
Three temp tables as follows:
 #CovidPatients (FK_Patient_Link_ID, FirstCovidPositiveDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- FirstCovidPositiveDate - earliest COVID diagnosis
 #CovidPatientsAllDiagnoses (FK_Patient_Link_ID, CovidPositiveDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- CovidPositiveDate - any COVID diagnosis
 #CovidPatientsMultipleDiagnoses
	-	FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	-	FirstCovidPositiveDate - date of first COVID diagnosis
	-	SecondCovidPositiveDate - date of second COVID diagnosis
	-	ThirdCovidPositiveDate - date of third COVID diagnosis
	-	FourthCovidPositiveDate - date of fourth COVID diagnosis
	-	FifthCovidPositiveDate - date of fifth COVID diagnosis

### Secondary admissions and length of stay
To obtain a table with every secondary care admission, along with the acute provider, the date of admission, the date of discharge, and the length of stay.

_Input_
```
One parameter

```
Two temp table as follows:
 #Admissions (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
  (Limited to one admission per person per hospital per day, because if a patient has 2 admissions
   on the same day to the same hopsital then it's most likely data duplication rather than two short
   hospital stays)
 #LengthOfStay (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..

## Clinical code sets

This project required the following clinical code sets:

- covid-positive-antigen-test v1
- covid-positive-pcr-test v1
- covid-positive-test-other v1
- covid-vaccination v1
- flu-vaccination v1
- flu-vaccine v1
- moderate-clinical-vulnerability v1
- severe-mental-illness v1
- high-clinical-vulnerability v1
- covid-vaccine-declined v1

Further details for each code set can be found below.

### COVID-19 positive antigen test

A code that indicates that a person has a positive antigen test for COVID-19.
#### COVID positive tests in primary care

The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets. However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of `covid-positive-antigen-test`, `covid-positive-pcr-test` and `covid-positive-test-other`.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `18.6% - 20.5%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined. _NB - this code set needs to rely on the SuppliedCode in the database rather than the foreign key ids._

### COVID-19 positive pcr test

A code that indicates that a person has a positive pcr test for COVID-19.
#### COVID positive tests in primary care

The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets.

### COVID-19 positive test - other

A code that indicates that a person has a positive test for COVID-19, but where the type of test (antigen or PCR) is unknown.
#### COVID positive tests in primary care

The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets.

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `1.19% - 26.55%` as of 11th March 2021 is too wide. However the prevalence figure of 26.55% from EMIS is close to public data and is likely ok.

**UPDATE - 25th March 2021** Missing Read and CTV3 codes were added to the vaccination list and now the range of `26.91% - 32.96%` seems reasonable. It should be noted that there is an approx 2 week lag between events occurring and them being entered in the record.

**UPDATE - 12th April 2021**, latest prevalence figures.

**UPDATE - 18th March 2022** There are now new codes for things like 3rd/4th/booster dose of vaccine. The latest prevalence shows `65.0% - 66.3%` have at least one vaccine code in the GP_Events table, and `88.2% - 93.6%` have at least one code for the vaccine in the GP_Medications table.

### At moderate risk of complications with COVID-19

These codes were used by system suppliers to indicate whether a patient was at moderate risk of complications if contracting COVID-19.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `0.01% - 1.25%` is too wide so these codes are not sufficiently well recorded in practice. Also the figure of `1.25%` is far lower than the actual figure is expected to be from public data.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |    31107 (1.12%) |     32588 (1.25%) |
| 2021-03-11 | TPP             | 210333     |       21 (0.01%) |        26 (0.01%) |
| 2021-03-11 | Vision          | 333251     |      6 (0.0018%) |      3136 (0.94%) |

### Severe mental illness

Defined as any diagnosis of:

- Psychotic disorder
- Bipolar disorder
- Schizophrenia

or patients on the severe mental illness register.

CTV3 code sets from OpenSafely.

SNOMED code set created from the following codes and all their descendants:

| SNOMED code | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 391193001   | On severe mental illness register (finding) |
| 69322001    | Psychotic disorder (disorder)               |
| 13746004    | Bipolar disorder (disorder)                 |
| 58214004    | Schizophrenia (disorder)                    |
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `1.04% - 1.77%` is perhaps too wide suggesting there is an underreporting from TPP practices - or the CTV3 code set differs from the others.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |    46405 (1.78%) |     46081 (1.77%) |
| 2021-03-11 | TPP             | 210333     |     2200 (1.05%) |      2196 (1.04%) |
| 2021-03-11 | Vision          | 333251     |     6770 (2.03%) |      5338 (1.60%) |

### At high risk of complications with COVID-19

These codes were used by system suppliers to indicate whether a patient was at high risk of complications if contracting COVID-19. EMIS practices originally used the code "9d44. - Risk of exposure to communicable disease (situation)" until they were able to use the SNOMED codes.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `5.78% - 6.18%` is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined - but only when using the supplied clinical codes.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |   158791 (6.11%) |    160665 (6.18%) |
| 2021-03-11 | TPP             | 210333     |      497 (0.24%) |     12159 (5.78%) |
| 2021-03-11 | Vision          | 333251     |    11469 (3.44%) |     19965 (5.99%) |

### Covid vaccine declined

Any codes indicating the patient has declined the vaccine for COVID-19.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `0.78% - 0.82%` for EMIS and TPP seems plausible. But in comparison the `0.40%` for Vision systems seems on the low side. There may be some extra Read v2 codes we haven't identified.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-25 | EMIS            | 2602984    |     1783 (0.07%) |     21305 (0.82%) |
| 2021-03-25 | TPP             | 210441     |        2 (0.00%) |      1650 (0.78%) |
| 2021-03-25 | Vision          | 333572     |        0 (0.00%) |      1319 (0.40%) |
