# The equitability of the UK COVID-19 vaccination strategy

## Summary

The government plan for the roll out of the COVID vaccines aims to protect the most vulnerable first, giving priority access to people with the highest risk of hospitalisation or mortality from COVID. We aim to use electronic health data from across Greater Manchester to test whether the government vaccination plan meets the goal of giving equal priority to people with equal vulnerability to COVID.
