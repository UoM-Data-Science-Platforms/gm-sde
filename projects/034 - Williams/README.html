<h1>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the effectiveness of eTrigger tools</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A “trigger tool” is a useful way for clinicians to find patients who may need further attention. Each “trigger” is an event, or a combination of events, in the patient’s health record that could (but don’t always) indicate that something has gone wrong. Examples would include:
- a patient who has an unplanned hospital admission within a few days of a GP visit (It could be coincidence, or it could be that something was missed by the GP)
- or a patient who has all the symptoms of a disease but who does not have a diagnosis in their record (if a condition is present, but is not diagnosed, then it might not be being treated, which would likely lead to problems for the patient)</p>
<p>Trigger tools can help clinicians find patient safety issues that have occurred and take steps to prevent them happening in the future. If a patient is flagged up by a trigger, a clinician would need to examine their record to determine if something has happened, and decide if further action is necessary. If too many patients are found by a trigger, then it leads to too high a burden on the clinician. Similarly, if the proportion of patients flagged who actually require attention is too low, then the clinician will waste a lot of time reviewing records. Therefore, ideally, each trigger would identify a small number of patients, and a high proportion of them would need further attention. All existing eTrigger tools have been designed in this way.</p>
<p>However, each trigger tool has been developed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown what the impact of the pandemic has had on the number of patients flagging each trigger, and therefore how useful they are for analysing this period of time.</p>
<p>We aim to report on how many patients were flagging against each of a selection of triggers, before and during the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.</li>
<li>A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.</li>
<li>A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.</p>
<h2>Reusable queries</h2>
<p>This project required the following reusable queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patient GP encounters</li>
<li>Classify secondary admissions</li>
<li>GET practice and ccg for each patient</li>
<li>CCG lookup table</li>
<li>Year of birth</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details for each query can be found below.</p>
<h3>Patient GP encounters</h3>
<p>To produce a table of GP encounters for a list of patients. This script uses many codes related to observations (e.g. blood pressure), symptoms, and diagnoses, to infer when GP encounters occured. This script includes face to face and telephone encounters - it will need copying and editing if you don't require both.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>multiple codes on the same day will be classed as one encounter (so max daily encounters per patient is 1)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>A temp table as follows:
 #GPEncounters (FK_Patient_Link_ID, EncounterDate)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- EncounterDate - date the patient had a GP encounter
</code></pre>

<hr>
<h3>Classify secondary admissions</h3>
<p>To categorise admissions to secondary care into 5 categories: Maternity, Unplanned, Planned, Transfer and Unknown.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We assume patients can only have one admission per day. This is probably not true, but where we see multiple admissions it is more likely to be data duplication, or internal admissions, than an admission, discharge and another admission in the same day.</li>
<li>Where patients have multiple admissions we choose the &quot;highest&quot; category for admission with the categories ranked as follows: Maternity &gt; Unplanned &gt; Planned &gt; Transfer &gt; Unknown</li>
<li>We have used the following classifications based on the AdmissionTypeCode:
<ul>
<li>PLANNED: PL (ELECTIVE PLANNED), 11 (Elective - Waiting List), WL (ELECTIVE WL), 13 (Elective - Planned), 12 (Elective - Booked), BL (ELECTIVE BOOKED), D (NULL), Endoscopy (Endoscopy), OP (DIRECT OUTPAT CLINIC), Venesection (X36.2 Venesection), Colonoscopy (H22.9 Colonoscopy), Medical (Medical)</li>
<li>UNPLANNED: AE (AE.DEPT.OF PROVIDER), 21 (Emergency - Local A&amp;E), I (NULL), GP (GP OR LOCUM GP), 22 (Emergency - GP), 23 (Emergency - Bed Bureau), 28 (Emergency - Other (inc other provider A&amp;E)), 2D (Emergency - Other), 24 (Emergency - Clinic), EM (EMERGENCY OTHER), AI (ACUTE TO INTMED CARE), BB (EMERGENCY BED BUREAU), DO (EMERGENCY DOMICILE), 2A (A+E Department of another provider where the Patient has not been admitted), A+E (Admission	 A+E Admission), Emerg (GP	Emergency GP Patient)</li>
<li>MATERNITY: 31 (Maternity ante-partum), BH (BABY BORN IN HOSP), AN (MATERNITY ANTENATAL), 82 (Birth in this Health Care Provider), PN (MATERNITY POST NATAL), B (NULL), 32 (Maternity post-partum), BHOSP (Birth in this Health Care Provider)</li>
<li>TRANSFER: 81 (Transfer from other hosp (not A&amp;E)), TR (PLAN TRANS TO TRUST), ET (EM TRAN (OTHER PROV)), HospTran (Transfer from other NHS Hospital), T (TRANSFER), CentTrans (Transfer from CEN Site)</li>
<li>OTHER: Anything else not previously classified</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>No pre-requisites
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>A temp table as follows:
 #AdmissionTypes (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider, AdmissionType)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
	- AdmissionType - One of: Maternity/Unplanned/Planned/Transfer/Unknown

<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>Two temp tables as follows:
 #PatientPractice (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode)

<hr>
<h3>CCG lookup table</h3>
<p>To provide lookup table for CCG names. The GMCR provides the CCG id (e.g. '00T', '01G') but not the CCG name. This table can be used in other queries when the output is required to be a ccg name rather than an id.</p>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>No pre-requisites
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>A temp table as follows:

<hr>
<h3>Year of birth</h3>
<p>To get the year of birth for each patient.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple YOBs we determine the YOB as follows:</li>
<li>If the patients has a YOB in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date</li>
<li>If every YOB for a patient is the same, then we use that</li>
<li>If there is a single most recently updated YOB in the database then we use that</li>
<li>Otherwise we take the highest YOB for the patient that is not in the future</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort

</ul>
<p>Further details for each code set can be found below.</p>
<h3>Haemoglobin</h3>
<p>A patient's haemoglobin as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (<code>423.. - Haemoglobin estimation</code>). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's haemoglobin (<code>4235 - Haemoglobin low</code>) without giving the actual value.</p>
<p>Haemoglobin codes were retrieved from https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/suppl/2020/05/19/2020.05.14.20101626.DC1/2020.05.14.20101626-1.pdf.</p>
<p><strong>NB: This code set is intended to only indicate a patient's haemoglobin values.</strong></p>
<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range <code>59.66% - 62.03%</code> suggests that this code set is likely well defined.</p>

<h3>Parkinson's disease</h3>
<p>Any code indicating a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Excludes other diseases causing Parkinsonism.</p>
<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range <code>0.13% - 0.15%</code> suggests that this code set is well defined.</p>
