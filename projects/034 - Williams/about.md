# The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the effectiveness of eTrigger tools

## Summary

A “trigger tool” is a useful way for clinicians to find patients who may need further attention. Each “trigger” is an event, or a combination of events, in the patient’s health record that could (but don’t always) indicate that something has gone wrong. Examples would include:
    - a patient who has an unplanned hospital admission within a few days of a GP visit (It could be coincidence, or it could be that something was missed by the GP)
    - or a patient who has all the symptoms of a disease but who does not have a diagnosis in their record (if a condition is present, but is not diagnosed, then it might not be being treated, which would likely lead to problems for the patient)

Trigger tools can help clinicians find patient safety issues that have occurred and take steps to prevent them happening in the future. If a patient is flagged up by a trigger, a clinician would need to examine their record to determine if something has happened, and decide if further action is necessary. If too many patients are found by a trigger, then it leads to too high a burden on the clinician. Similarly, if the proportion of patients flagged who actually require attention is too low, then the clinician will waste a lot of time reviewing records. Therefore, ideally, each trigger would identify a small number of patients, and a high proportion of them would need further attention. All existing eTrigger tools have been designed in this way.

However, each trigger tool has been developed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown what the impact of the pandemic has had on the number of patients flagging each trigger, and therefore how useful they are for analysing this period of time.

We aim to report on how many patients were flagging against each of a selection of triggers, before and during the pandemic.
