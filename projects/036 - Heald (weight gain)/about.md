# First Episode Psychosis (FEP) and Weight Gain vs COVID-19 outcomees

## Summary

- We plan to investigate predictors of weight change and blood glucose change in people diagnosed with First Episode Psychosis (FEP) or starting treatment with an anti-psychotic agent.
- We will determine if there is any relation between weight change and the likelihood of becoming seriously unwell or dying after a COVID-19 infection for those with a previous diagnosis of FEP who were alive in January 2020.
