# How much has COVID-19 vaccination made a difference to outcomes for people with diabetes

## Summary

Utilising the Greater Manchester (GM) Care Record we have recently shown that for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), the risk of dying following a COVID-19 infection was greatest in March/April 2020. Interestingly, it was less in January and February 2021 than July 2020, with a progressive decrease in odds ratio of death from the start of 2021. From December 2020, the proportion of T2DM individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 has steadily risen across GM for initially the first vaccination then subsequently for the second vaccination.

Going forward our primary question is: does the COVID-19 vaccination protect against hospitalisation or death following confirmed infection or how at an individual level vaccination influences risk of hospitalisation/death, following confirmed COVID-19 infection in diabetes individuals vs controls matched for age/gender/ethnicity/social disadvantage in order to amplify the visibility of factors such that are relevant to risk in diabetes.
