<h1>Variation in frailty across the city of Greater Manchester and the influence of frailty on adverse consequences of COVID-19 infection as measured by hospital admission or death</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterised by increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes including falls, fractures and increased use of health and social care services. Data from population surveys suggest that overall approximately one in twelve men and women in the UK age 50 years have evidence of frailty. However, to date there are no data characterising the distribution of frailty across a large urban conurbation and exploring how it varies by small area, level of deprivation and ethnicity. Such data are important in understanding the causes of frailty and informing strategies for prevention aimed at reducing inequalities in ageing.</p>
<p>We hypothesise that within GM, areas with a high risk of frailty would be associated with a high risk also of less favourable COVID-19 outcome and that identification of areas at high risk would provide opportunities for targeted prevention measures as we move into the period of living with the COVID-19 virus.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.</li>
<li>A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.</li>
<li>A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.</p>
<h2>Reusable queries</h2>
<p>This project required the following reusable queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calcluate Electronic Frailty Index</li>
<li>Electronic Frailty Index common queries</li>
<li>Electronic Frailty Index subquery</li>
<li>Electronic Frailty Index subquery</li>
<li>Townsend Score (2011)</li>
<li>Lower level super output area</li>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Define Cohort for RQ038: COVID + frailty project</li>
<li>Year of birth</li>
<li>Patients with COVID</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details for each query can be found below.</p>
<h3>Calcluate Electronic Frailty Index</h3>
<p>To calculate the EFI for all patients and how it has changed over time</p>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Takes three parameters
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is &quot;SharedCare.GP_Events&quot; but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode

<h3>Patients with COVID</h3>
<p>To get tables of all patients with a COVID diagnosis in their record. This now includes a table that has reinfections. This uses a 90 day cut-off to rule out patients that get multiple tests for a single infection. This 90 day cut-off is also used in the government COVID dashboard. In the first wave, prior to widespread COVID testing, and prior to the correct clinical codes being	available to clinicians, infections were recorded in a variety of ways. We therefore take the first diagnosis from any code indicative of COVID. However, for subsequent infections we insist on the presence of a positive COVID test (PCR or antigen) as opposed to simply a diagnosis code. This is to avoid the situation where a hospital diagnosis code gets entered into the primary care record several months after the actual infection.</p>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Takes three parameters
  - start-date: string - (YYYY-MM-DD) the date to count diagnoses from. Usually this should be 2020-01-01.
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is &quot;SharedCare.GP_Events&quot; but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>Three temp tables as follows:
 #CovidPatients (FK_Patient_Link_ID, FirstCovidPositiveDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- FirstCovidPositiveDate - earliest COVID diagnosis
 #CovidPatientsAllDiagnoses (FK_Patient_Link_ID, CovidPositiveDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- CovidPositiveDate - any COVID diagnosis
 #CovidPatientsMultipleDiagnoses
	-	FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	-	FirstCovidPositiveDate - date of first COVID diagnosis
	-	SecondCovidPositiveDate - date of second COVID diagnosis
	-	ThirdCovidPositiveDate - date of third COVID diagnosis
	-	FourthCovidPositiveDate - date of fourth COVID diagnosis
	-	FifthCovidPositiveDate - date of fifth COVID diagnosis

<h3>COVID-19 positive antigen test</h3>
<p>A code that indicates that a person has a positive antigen test for COVID-19.</p>
<h4>COVID positive tests in primary care</h4>
<p>The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets. However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of <code>covid-positive-antigen-test</code>, <code>covid-positive-pcr-test</code> and <code>covid-positive-test-other</code>.</p>
<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range <code>18.6% - 20.5%</code> suggests that this code set is likely well defined. <em>NB - this code set needs to rely on the SuppliedCode in the database rather than the foreign key ids.</em></p>

However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of <code>covid-positive-antigen-test</code>, <code>covid-positive-pcr-test</code> and <code>covid-positive-test-other</code>.</p>
<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range <code>18.6% - 20.5%</code> suggests that this code set is likely well defined. <em>NB - this code set needs to rely on the SuppliedCode in the database rather than the foreign key ids.</em></p>
