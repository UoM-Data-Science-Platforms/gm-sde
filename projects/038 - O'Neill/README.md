# Variation in frailty across the city of Greater Manchester and the influence of frailty on adverse consequences of COVID-19 infection as measured by hospital admission or death

## Summary

Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterised by increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes including falls, fractures and increased use of health and social care services. Data from population surveys suggest that overall approximately one in twelve men and women in the UK age 50 years have evidence of frailty. However, to date there are no data characterising the distribution of frailty across a large urban conurbation and exploring how it varies by small area, level of deprivation and ethnicity. Such data are important in understanding the causes of frailty and informing strategies for prevention aimed at reducing inequalities in ageing.

We hypothesise that within GM, areas with a high risk of frailty would be associated with a high risk also of less favourable COVID-19 outcome and that identification of areas at high risk would provide opportunities for targeted prevention measures as we move into the period of living with the COVID-19 virus.

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Calcluate Electronic Frailty Index
- Electronic Frailty Index common queries

### Calcluate Electronic Frailty Index
To calculate the EFI for all patients and how it has changed over time

_Input_
```
Takes one parameter
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "SharedCare.GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
 And assumes there is a temp table #Patients (this can't be run on all patients at present as it takes too long)
```

_Output_
```
One temp tables as follows:
	#PatientEFIOverTime (FK_Patient_Link_ID, NumberOfDeficits, DateFrom)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- DateFrom - the date from which the patient had this number of deficits
	- NumberOfDeficits - the number of deficits (e.g. 3)

### Electronic Frailty Index subquery
Subquery for the EFI calculation to ensure consistency. This allows a code with a value within a range to be counted towards a deficit

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table #EfiEvents(FK_Patient_Link_ID, Deficit, EventDate) and
        a temp table #EfiValueData(FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, SuppliedCode, Value)
  ALso takes parameters
  - efi-category: string - e.g. "activity-limitation" to match the "efi-activity-limitation" code set
	-	patients: temp table name - OPTIONAL - e.g. "#Patients" allows filtering to just some patients
	- supplied-codes: string - (of form 'code','code2',...,'coden') the codes to include
  - min-value: int - OPTIONAL - The minimum value to count. Strict inequality so "0" would become >0
  - max-value: int - OPTIONAL - The maximum value to count. Strict inequality so "0" would become <0
```

_Output_
```
None. This populates the pre-existing #EfiEvents table with the first time the patient experienced the deficit specified by the efi-category.

### Patients with COVID
To get tables of all patients with a COVID diagnosis in their record. This now includes a table that has reinfections. This uses a 90 day cut-off to rule out patients that get multiple tests for a single infection. This 90 day cut-off is also used in the government COVID dashboard. In the first wave, prior to widespread COVID testing, and prior to the correct clinical codes being	available to clinicians, infections were recorded in a variety of ways. We therefore take the first diagnosis from any code indicative of COVID. However, for subsequent infections we insist on the presence of a positive COVID test (PCR or antigen) as opposed to simply a diagnosis code. This is to avoid the situation where a hospital diagnosis code gets entered into the primary care record several months after the actual infection.

_Input_
```
Takes three parameters
  - start-date: string - (YYYY-MM-DD) the date to count diagnoses from. Usually this should be 2020-01-01.

```

_Output_
```
Three temp tables as follows:

### Year of birth
To get the year of birth for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple YOBs we determine the YOB as follows:
- If the patients has a YOB in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every YOB for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated YOB in the database then we use that
- Otherwise we take the highest YOB for the patient that is not in the future

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientYearOfBirth (FK_Patient_Link_ID, YearOfBirth)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- YearOfBirth - INT
```

### COVID-19 positive antigen test

A code that indicates that a person has a positive antigen test for COVID-19.
#### COVID positive tests in primary care

The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets. However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of `covid-positive-antigen-test`, `covid-positive-pcr-test` and `covid-positive-test-other`.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `19.7% - 25.4%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined. _NB - this code set needs to rely on the SuppliedCode in the database rather than the foreign key ids._

_Update **2024-01-23**: Prevalence now 23% - 25%._

### COVID-19 positive pcr test

A code that indicates that a person has a positive pcr test for COVID-19.
#### COVID positive tests in primary care

### Long COVID diagnosis

Any code indicating a diagnosis of long-covid / post-covid syndrome. There are also code sets for [long-covid-assessment](../../../patient/long-covid-assessment/) and [long-covid-referral](../../../patient/long-covid-referral/).
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.095% - 0.401%` suggests missing codes from TPP practices. However, there is literature showing that all long covid codes are poorly used (https://doi.org/10.3399%2FBJGP.2021.0301 and https://www.adruk.org/fileadmin/uploads/adruk/Documents/Data_Insights/Clinical_coding_and_capture_of_Long_COVID_V.3__4_.pdf).

### Long COVID referral

Any code indicating a referral for long-covid / post-covid syndrome. There are also code sets for [long-covid-diagnosis](../../../conditions/long-covid-diagnosis/) and [long-covid-assessment](../../long-covid-assessment/).
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.15% - 0.657%` suggests missing codes from Vision and TPP practices. However, there is literature showing that all long covid codes are poorly used (https://doi.org/10.3399%2FBJGP.2021.0301 and https://www.adruk.org/fileadmin/uploads/adruk/Documents/Data_Insights/Clinical_coding_and_capture_of_Long_COVID_V.3__4_.pdf).

### Long COVID assessment

Any code indicating an assessment of long-covid / post-covid syndrome. There are also code sets for [long-covid-diagnosis](../../../conditions/long-covid-diagnosis/) and [long-covid-referral](../../long-covid-referral/).
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.0% - 0.007%` suggests missing codes from all practices. However, there is literature showing that all long covid codes are poorly used (https://doi.org/10.3399%2FBJGP.2021.0301 and https://www.adruk.org/fileadmin/uploads/adruk/Documents/Data_Insights/Clinical_coding_and_capture_of_Long_COVID_V.3__4_.pdf). So this is probably lack of use rather than missing codes.

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `1.19% - 26.55%` as of 11th March 2021 is too wide. However the prevalence figure of 26.55% from EMIS is close to public data and is likely ok.

**UPDATE - 25th March 2021** Missing Read and CTV3 codes were added to the vaccination list and now the range of `26.91% - 32.96%` seems reasonable. It should be noted that there is an approx 2 week lag between events occurring and them being entered in the record.

**UPDATE - 12th April 2021**, latest prevalence figures.

**UPDATE - 18th March 2022** There are now new codes for things like 3rd/4th/booster dose of vaccine. The latest prevalence shows `65.0% - 66.3%` have at least one vaccine code in the GP_Events table, and `88.2% - 93.6%` have at least one code for the vaccine in the GP_Medications table.

**UPDATE - 24th January 2024** There has clearly been a reporting change as the prevalence of the vaccine as a medication has gone down. The event codes for the administration of the COVID vaccine seem to be the reliable place to find this informaiton.

### Severe mental illness

Defined as any diagnosis of:

- Psychotic disorder
- Bipolar disorder
- Schizophrenia

or patients on the severe mental illness register.

CTV3 code sets from OpenSafely and the NHS PCD refsets.

SNOMED code set supplemented from the following codes and all their descendants:

| SNOMED code | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 391193001   | On severe mental illness register (finding) |

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `1.04% - 1.77%` is perhaps too wide suggesting there is an underreporting from TPP practices - or the CTV3 code set differs from the others.

_Update **2024-03-15**: Prevalence now 1.14% - 1.18% which suggests it is now well defined._

### Heart failure

Any code indicating a diagnosis, or presence of heart failure. Does not include "History of" heart failure codes.

- Excludes "Cor pulmonale" as although this usually leads to heart failure, but is not heart failure.
- Also does not include "Chronic pulmonary heart disease" or "pulmonary oedema". Both of which can lead to heart failure but are not heart failure.
#### Notes

The code `G581.` (read v2 and CTV3) includes "Left ventricular failure" and "Pulmonary oedema - acute" as synonyms for CTV3 but not read v2. These are not synonyms and we want the former but not the latter. Given the read v2 code is just "left ventricular failure" we include this code, but it is possible we match some patients with only a pulmonary oedema.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.92% - 1.15%` is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined.

_Update **2024-01-19**: Prevalence now 1.06% - 1.28%. TPP still with slightly higher prevalence, but sufficiently close to EMIS and Vision._

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `63.96% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.

**UPDATE** By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes `62.48% - 64.93%` which suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2023/11/01**: prevalence now `61.2% - 65.7%` for EMIS and VISION. TPP higher at 73%._

### Haemoglobin

A patient's haemoglobin as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`423.. - Haemoglobin estimation`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's haemoglobin (`4235 - Haemoglobin low`) without giving the actual value.

Haemoglobin codes were retrieved from https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/suppl/2020/05/19/2020.05.14.20101626.DC1/2020.05.14.20101626-1.pdf.

**NB: This code set is intended to only indicate a patient's haemoglobin values.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `61% - 68.1%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.

_Update **2024-03-15**: Prevalence now 60% - 62%._
