# Variation in frailty across the city of Greater Manchester and the influence of frailty on adverse consequences of COVID-19 infection as measured by hospital admission or death

## Summary

Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterised by increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes including falls, fractures and increased use of health and social care services. Data from population surveys suggest that overall approximately one in twelve men and women in the UK age 50 years have evidence of frailty. However, to date there are no data characterising the distribution of frailty across a large urban conurbation and exploring how it varies by small area, level of deprivation and ethnicity. Such data are important in understanding the causes of frailty and informing strategies for prevention aimed at reducing inequalities in ageing.

We hypothesise that within GM, areas with a high risk of frailty would be associated with a high risk also of less favourable COVID-19 outcome and that identification of areas at high risk would provide opportunities for targeted prevention measures as we move into the period of living with the COVID-19 virus.
