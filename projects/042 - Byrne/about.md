# What can GMCR tell us about attendance and prescription patterns for dental problems seen in primary medical care before and during covid?

## Summary

Six GP consultations per 1000 patient-years in the UK from 2016-2019 were for dental problems. The COVID-19
pandemic has resulted in 68.7% fewer courses of NHS dental treatment in 2020-2021 , this lack of access to dental
care may have led patients to seek care from GPs instead. GPs cannot properly diagnose dental disease and, before
COVID, 57.1% of consultations with a GP for dental problems resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Treating dental
conditions is outside of the scope of GPs as dental problems require dental procedures rather than prescriptions. GPs
seeing people with dental problems is, therefore, an inefficient use of time and resources, and raises concerns
surrounding antibiotic resistance which is driven by inappropriate use of antibiotics.

Greater Manchester (GM) has some of the poorest dental health in England and is a good test case to assess changes
in attendance patterns in GP and onward prescriptions. At present, there are no data available relating to GP
consultations for dental problems in GM, nor the outcomes of those consultations. The GMCR provides a key
opportunity to explore this issue within GM and factors that may be associated with it.
