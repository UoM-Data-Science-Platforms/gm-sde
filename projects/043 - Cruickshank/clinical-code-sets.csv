All clinical codes used by this project.
NB. This file is auto-generated.
Some clinical codes become garbled when opening csv files in MS Excel. This is because Excel attempts to convert them to a number. For example SNOMED codes above 11 digits appear in scientific notation format (1.03e11) while Read codes with a trailing decimal point such as '1371.' lose the '.' and becomes 1371
To get round this we provide the clinical codes in two columns:
- The [Code] column contains the raw values and can be used if this file is viewed in a text editor or processed by statistical software.
- The [ExcelCode] column behaves when opened in Excel and is to be used if the column needs to be copy/pasted
