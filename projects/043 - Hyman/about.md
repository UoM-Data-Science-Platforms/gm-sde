# Air Pollution Exposure and COVID-19 Severity: A Retrospective Study in Greater Manchester

## Summary

Several national and international studies have linked long- and short-term air pollution exposure to incidence and mortality of COVID-19. However, most of these studies have focused on regional exposures such as PM2.5 and NO2 and findings have mostly been drawn from ecological analyses using population level data on air pollution exposure and COVID-19 outcomes aggregated over various geospatial areas (Chen et al, 2021). This is problematic as ecological studies infer association at the population level, whereas it may not exist at an individual level, and it can also be difficult to detect complicated exposure-outcome relationships.

Our research would aim to further explore the link between long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 severity.
