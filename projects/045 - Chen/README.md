# Towards understanding the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in Greater Manchester

## Summary

Vaccination is widely accepted as the most effective way to protect people against infection by viruses, including
Covid-19, but vaccine hesitancy has always existed among a proportion of people and it has been listed as one of
the “ten threats to global health” by the World Health Organization (WHO)
(https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019). 

Thus, it is crucial to understand the determinants which are likely to influence people’s vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in order to support
vaccine deployment and vaccination policy making.

This study aims to identify the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in Greater Manchester
(GM) through analysing the abundant GMCR data on different granularity levels, including:

• Regional disparities of Covid-19 vaccination coverage across Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) in GM
(LSOA level);
• Household vaccination status clusters, through creating an anonymised 'household' variables as in
OpenSafely, CIPHA and Scottish integrated records (Household level); We understand that this is not
currently available. Our analysis can continue without this, but we would like this data if it comes available
before the end date of the project.
• Analysis of the factors, which might affect individuals’ vaccination decision making in GM (Individual level);
• Identification of citizen “groups” exist in GM LSOAs based on the level of vaccine hesitancy, and profile each
“group” identified based on their demographic and social-economic information (Data analytics to support
vaccination policy making).

Both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that a variety of factors, such as safety of vaccines,
severity of diseases, socioeconomic status, information and advice from healthcare professionals, influence an
individual’s intention to vaccinate. The overarching challenge to be addressed in this study is to capture the
correlations between the vaccination decision making and a variety of cross-sectional factors in GMCR (such as
demographics, social-economic factors, high vulnerability to COVID-19, vaccine types, uptake records of other
non-Covid-19 vaccines).

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- BMI
- height and weight, standardised in centimetres
- Care home status
- Index Multiple Deprivation
- Patient received flu vaccine in a given time period
- COVID vaccinations
- Patients with a COVID test result
- COVID-related secondary admissions
- Patients with COVID
- Secondary admissions and length of stay
- Secondary discharges
- Define Cohort for RQ045: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance

---
### Patients with COVID
To get tables of all patients with a COVID diagnosis in their record. This now includes a table that has reinfections. This uses a 90 day cut-off to rule out patients that get multiple tests for a single infection. This 90 day cut-off is also used in the government COVID dashboard. In the first wave, prior to widespread COVID testing, and prior to the correct clinical codes being	available to clinicians, infections were recorded in a variety of ways. We therefore take the first diagnosis from any code indicative of COVID. However, for subsequent infections we insist on the presence of a positive COVID test (PCR or antigen) as opposed to simply a diagnosis code. This is to avoid the situation where a hospital diagnosis code gets entered into the primary care record several months after the actual infection.

_Input_
```
Takes three parameters
  - start-date: string - (YYYY-MM-DD) the date to count diagnoses from. Usually this should be 2020-01-01.
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "SharedCare.GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode

## Clinical code sets

This project required the following clinical code sets:

- covid-positive-antigen-test v1
- covid-positive-pcr-test v1
- covid-positive-test-other v1
- covid-vaccination v1
- flu-vaccination v1
- flu-vaccine v1
- cancer v1
- asthma v1
- anxiety v1
- long-covid v1
- severe-mental-illness v1
- height v1
- weight v1
- bmi v2

Further details for each code set can be found below.

### COVID-19 positive antigen test

A code that indicates that a person has a positive antigen test for COVID-19.
#### COVID positive tests in primary care

The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets. However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of `covid-positive-antigen-test`, `covid-positive-pcr-test` and `covid-positive-test-other`.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `19.7% - 25.4%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined. _NB - this code set needs to rely on the SuppliedCode in the database rather than the foreign key ids._

_Update **2024-01-23**: Prevalence now 23% - 25%._

A code that indicates that a person has a positive pcr test for COVID-19.
#### COVID positive tests in primary care

The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets. However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of `covid-positive-antigen-test`, `covid-positive-pcr-test` and `covid-positive-test-other`.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `19.7% - 25.4%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined. _NB - this code set needs to rely on the SuppliedCode in the database rather than the foreign key ids._

_Update **2024-01-23**: Prevalence now 23% - 25%._

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `1.19% - 26.55%` as of 11th March 2021 is too wide. However the prevalence figure of 26.55% from EMIS is close to public data and is likely ok.

**UPDATE - 25th March 2021** Missing Read and CTV3 codes were added to the vaccination list and now the range of `26.91% - 32.96%` seems reasonable. It should be noted that there is an approx 2 week lag between events occurring and them being entered in the record.

**UPDATE - 12th April 2021**, latest prevalence figures.

**UPDATE - 18th March 2022** There are now new codes for things like 3rd/4th/booster dose of vaccine. The latest prevalence shows `65.0% - 66.3%` have at least one vaccine code in the GP_Events table, and `88.2% - 93.6%` have at least one code for the vaccine in the GP_Medications table.

**UPDATE - 24th January 2024** There has clearly been a reporting change as the prevalence of the vaccine as a medication has gone down. The event codes for the administration of the COVID vaccine seem to be the reliable place to find this informaiton.

### Height

A patient's height as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`229.. - O/E - Height`).

Codes taken from https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/suppl/2020/05/19/2020.05.14.20101626.DC1/2020.05.14.20101626-1.pdf
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `66.10% - 72.59%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2023/11/07**: prevalence now `71% - 74%`_

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `63.96% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.

**UPDATE** By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes `62.48% - 64.93%` which suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2023/11/01**: prevalence now `61.2% - 65.7%` for EMIS and VISION. TPP higher at 73%._
