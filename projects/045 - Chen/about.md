# Towards understanding the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in Greater Manchester

## Summary

Vaccination is widely accepted as the most effective way to protect people against infection by viruses, including
Covid-19, but vaccine hesitancy has always existed among a proportion of people and it has been listed as one of
the “ten threats to global health” by the World Health Organization (WHO)
(https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019). 

Thus, it is crucial to understand the determinants which are likely to influence people’s vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in order to support
vaccine deployment and vaccination policy making.

This study aims to identify the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in Greater Manchester
(GM) through analysing the abundant GMCR data on different granularity levels, including:

• Regional disparities of Covid-19 vaccination coverage across Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) in GM
(LSOA level);
• Household vaccination status clusters, through creating an anonymised 'household' variables as in
OpenSafely, CIPHA and Scottish integrated records (Household level); We understand that this is not
currently available. Our analysis can continue without this, but we would like this data if it comes available
before the end date of the project.
• Analysis of the factors, which might affect individuals’ vaccination decision making in GM (Individual level);
• Identification of citizen “groups” exist in GM LSOAs based on the level of vaccine hesitancy, and profile each
“group” identified based on their demographic and social-economic information (Data analytics to support
vaccination policy making).

Both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that a variety of factors, such as safety of vaccines,
severity of diseases, socioeconomic status, information and advice from healthcare professionals, influence an
individual’s intention to vaccinate. The overarching challenge to be addressed in this study is to capture the
correlations between the vaccination decision making and a variety of cross-sectional factors in GMCR (such as
demographics, social-economic factors, high vulnerability to COVID-19, vaccine types, uptake records of other
non-Covid-19 vaccines).
