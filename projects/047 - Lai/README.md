## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Alcohol Intake
- Smoking status
- BMI
- Index Multiple Deprivation
- Lower level super output area
- GET practice and ccg for each patient
- CCG lookup table
- Year of birth
- Sex

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Alcohol Intake
To get the alcohol status for each patient in a cohort.

_Assumptions_

- We take the most recent alcohol intake code in a patient's record to be correct

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
 Also takes one parameter:
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, FK_Reference_Coding_ID, and FK_Reference_SnomedCT_ID
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientAlcoholIntake (FK_Patient_Link_ID, CurrentAlcoholIntake)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
  - WorstAlcoholIntake - [heavy drinker/moderate drinker/light drinker/non-drinker] - worst code
	- CurrentAlcoholIntake - [heavy drinker/moderate drinker/light drinker/non-drinker] - most recent code
```

---
### Smoking status
To get the smoking status for each patient in a cohort.

_Assumptions_

- We take the most recent smoking status in a patient's record to be correct
- However, there is likely confusion between the "non smoker" and "never smoked" codes. Especially as sometimes the synonyms for these codes overlap. Therefore, a patient wih a most recent smoking status of "never", but who has previous smoking codes, would be classed as WorstSmokingStatus=non-trivial-smoker / CurrentSmokingStatus=non-smoker

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
 Also takes one parameter:
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, FK_Reference_Coding_ID, and FK_Reference_SnomedCT_ID
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientSmokingStatus (FK_Patient_Link_ID, PassiveSmoker, WorstSmokingStatus, CurrentSmokingStatus)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- PassiveSmoker - Y/N (whether a patient has ever had a code for passive smoking)
	- WorstSmokingStatus - [non-trivial-smoker/trivial-smoker/non-smoker]
	- CurrentSmokingStatus - [non-trivial-smoker/trivial-smoker/non-smoker]
```

---
### BMI
To get the BMI for each patient in a cohort.

_Assumptions_

- We take the measurement closest to @IndexDate to be correct

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
 Also takes one parameter:
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, FK_Reference_Coding_ID, and FK_Reference_SnomedCT_ID
 Also assumes there is an @IndexDate defined - The index date of the study
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientBMI (FK_Patient_Link_ID, BMI, DateOfBMIMeasurement)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
  - BMI
  - DateOfBMIMeasurement

---
### Lower level super output area
To get the LSOA for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple LSOAs we determine the LSOA as follows:
- If the patients has an LSOA in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientLSOA (FK_Patient_Link_ID, LSOA)

 #PatientPractice (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- GPPracticeCode - the nationally recognised practice id for the patient
 #PatientPracticeAndCCG (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode, CCG)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- GPPracticeCode - the nationally recognised practice id for the patient
	- CCG - the name of the patient's CCG

---
### CCG lookup table
To provide lookup table for CCG names. The GMCR provides the CCG id (e.g. '00T', '01G') but not the CCG name. This table can be used in other queries when the output is required to be a ccg name rather than an id.

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #CCGLookup (CcgId, CcgName)
 	- CcgId - Nationally recognised ccg id

---
### Year of birth
To get the year of birth for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple YOBs we determine the YOB as follows:
- If the patients has a YOB in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every YOB for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated YOB in the database then we use that
- Otherwise we take the highest YOB for the patient that is not in the future

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientYearOfBirth (FK_Patient_Link_ID, YearOfBirth)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- YearOfBirth - INT
```

---
### Sex
To get the Sex for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple sexes we determine the sex as follows:
- If the patients has a sex in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every sex for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated sex in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's sex is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientSex (FK_Patient_Link_ID, Sex)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- Sex - M/F
```
_File_: `query-patient-sex.sql`

## Clinical code sets

This project required the following clinical code sets:

- bmi v2
- contraceptives-combined-hormonal v1
- contraceptives-progesterone-only v1
- contraceptives-devices v1
- cervical-smear v1
- diabetes v1
- hydrochlorothiazide v1
- immunosuppression v1
- hiv v1
- smoking-status-current v1
- smoking-status-currently-not v1
- smoking-status-ex v1
- smoking-status-ex-trivial v1
- smoking-status-never v1
- smoking-status-passive v1
- smoking-status-trivial v1
- alcohol-non-drinker v1
- alcohol-light-drinker v1
- alcohol-moderate-drinker v1
- alcohol-heavy-drinker v1
- alcohol-weekly-intake v1

Further details for each code set can be found below.

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `63.96% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.

**UPDATE** By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes `62.48% - 64.93%` which suggests that this code set is well defined.

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `12.29% - 13.25%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### Contraceptives - progesterone only

This code set was based on BNF codes (mapped to SNOMED) starting with 070302, following the approach used in https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/id/eprint/707403/4/Walker_2022.pdf
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `10.44% - 11.18%` suggests that this code set is well defined.


| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2022-05-04 | EMIS            | 2662112    |  288196 (10.83%) |      6054 (0.23%) |

### Contraceptives - devices

This code set was based on BNF codes (mapped to SNOMED) starting with '210400', following the approach in this paper: https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/id/eprint/707403/4/Walker_2022.pdf.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.27% - 1.86%` suggests potential underreporting for TPP practices.


| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2022-05-04 | EMIS            | 2662112    |   48059 (1.81%)  |    48418 (1.82%)  |

### Cervical smear

This set was created from getset.ga. These codes indicate patients who had cervical smear test (for example; cervical smear test result - negative), not the actual test event.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `29.2% - 32.2%` is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2022-09-12 | EMIS            | 2448237    |   718053 (29.3%) |    714376 (29.2%) |

### Diabetes mellitus

Code set for any diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type I/type II/other).

Developed from https://getset.ga.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `5.96% - 6.05%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### Hydrochlorothiazide
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.71% - 1.35%` suggests that this code set is well defined. Though the Vision practices are perhaps slighly on the low side, though this could be due to the small numbers.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |

### Immunosuppression

Codes that indicate a patient has a diagnosis of temporary or permanent immunosuppression, excluding HIV. SNOMED and CTV3 codelist are from the OpenSAFELY team (see below for links). The Read 2 codelist is from the LSHTM Data Compass.

- [Immunosuppression - permanent (CTV3)](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/permanent-immunosuppression/2020-06-02/)
- [Immunosuppression - temporary (CTV3)](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/temporary-immunosuppression/2020-04-24/)
- [Immunosuppression - permanent (SNOMED)](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/permanent-immunosuppression-snomed/2020-06-02/)
- [Immunosuppression - temporary (SNOMED)](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/temporary-immunosuppression-snomed/2020-04-24/)
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `0.30% - 0.50%` is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |    11815 (0.45%) |     11453 (0.44%) |

### HIV

Codes indicating a diagnosis of HIV. Snomed and CTV3 codelist are from the [OpenSafely project](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/hiv/2020-07-13/#full-list). The Read 2 codelist is from the LSHTM Data Compass.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.010% - 0.029%` is perhaps a bit wide, but as the numbers are so low it is likely well-defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |     760 (0.029%) |      760 (0.029%) |
| 2021-03-11 | TPP             | 210333     |      39 (0.019%) |       39 (0.019%) |
| 2021-03-11 | Vision          | 333251     |      34 (0.010%) |       34 (0.010%) |
