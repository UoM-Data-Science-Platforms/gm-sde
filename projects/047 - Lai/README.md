## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Lower level super output area
- GET practice and ccg for each patient
- CCG lookup table
- Year and quarter month of birth
- Index Multiple Deprivation
- Sex

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Lower level super output area
To get the LSOA for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple LSOAs we determine the LSOA as follows:
- If the patients has an LSOA in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientLSOA (FK_Patient_Link_ID, LSOA)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- LSOA_Code - nationally recognised LSOA identifier
```

---
### GET practice and ccg for each patient
For each patient to get the practice id that they are registered to, and the CCG name that the practice belongs to.

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
Two temp tables as follows:
 #PatientPractice (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- GPPracticeCode - the nationally recognised practice id for the patient
 #PatientPracticeAndCCG (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode, CCG)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- GPPracticeCode - the nationally recognised practice id for the patient
	- CCG - the name of the patient's CCG
```

---
### CCG lookup table
To provide lookup table for CCG names. The GMCR provides the CCG id (e.g. '00T', '01G') but not the CCG name. This table can be used in other queries when the output is required to be a ccg name rather than an id.

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #CCGLookup (CcgId, CcgName)
 	- CcgId - Nationally recognised ccg id
	- CcgName - Bolton, Stockport etc..
```
_File_: `query-ccg-lookup.sql`

---
### Year and quarter month of birth
To get the year of birth for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple YearAndQuarterMonthOfBirths we determine the YearAndQuarterMonthOfBirth as follows:
- If the patients has a YearAndQuarterMonthOfBirth in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every YearAndQuarterMonthOfBirth for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated YearAndQuarterMonthOfBirth in the database then we use that
- Otherwise we take the highest YearAndQuarterMonthOfBirth for the patient that is not in the future

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientYearAndQuarterMonthOfBirth (FK_Patient_Link_ID, YearAndQuarterMonthOfBirth)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- YearAndQuarterMonthOfBirth - (YYYY-MM-01)
```

---
### Index Multiple Deprivation
To get the 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) decile for each patient.

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientIMDDecile (FK_Patient_Link_ID, IMD2019Decile1IsMostDeprived10IsLeastDeprived)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- IMD2019Decile1IsMostDeprived10IsLeastDeprived - number 1 to 10 inclusive
```

---
### Sex
To get the Sex for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple sexes we determine the sex as follows:
- If the patients has a sex in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every sex for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated sex in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's sex is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```

### Immunosuppression

Codes that indicate a patient has a diagnosis of temporary or permanent immunosuppression, excluding HIV. SNOMED and CTV3 codelist are from the OpenSAFELY team (see below for links). The Read 2 codelist is from the LSHTM Data Compass.

- [Immunosuppression - permanent (CTV3)](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/permanent-immunosuppression/2020-06-02/)
- [Immunosuppression - temporary (CTV3)](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/temporary-immunosuppression/2020-04-24/)
- [Immunosuppression - permanent (SNOMED)](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/permanent-immunosuppression-snomed/2020-06-02/)
- [Immunosuppression - temporary (SNOMED)](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/temporary-immunosuppression-snomed/2020-04-24/)
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `0.30% - 0.50%` is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |    11815 (0.45%) |     11453 (0.44%) |
| 2021-03-11 | TPP             | 210333     |      625 (0.30%) |       625 (0.30%) |

### HIV

Codes indicating a diagnosis of HIV. Snomed and CTV3 codelist are from the [OpenSafely project](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/hiv/2020-07-13/#full-list). The Read 2 codelist is from the LSHTM Data Compass.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.010% - 0.029%` is perhaps a bit wide, but as the numbers are so low it is likely well-defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |     760 (0.029%) |      760 (0.029%) |

### Hydrochlorothiazide
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.71% - 1.35%` suggests that this code set is well defined. Though the Vision practices are perhaps slighly on the low side, though this could be due to the small numbers.

### Cervical smear

This set was created from getset.ga. These codes indicate patients who had cervical smear test (for example; cervical smear test result - negative), not the actual test event.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `29.2% - 32.2%` is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined.

### Hormone replacement therapy medications

This code set was created from BNF codes starting with 060401. A mapping from prod codes to BNF was used.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `9.73% - 12.27%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2022-06-28 | EMIS            | 2664831    |   259198 (9.73%) |  269103 (10.10%)  |

### Smoking status current

Any code suggestive that a patient is a current smoker.

### Smoking status currently not

Any code suggestive that a patient is currently a non-smoker. This is different to the "never smoked" code set.

### Smoking status ex

Any code suggestive that a patient is an ex-smoker.

### Smoking status never

Any code suggestive that a patient has never smoked. This is different to the "currently not" code set.

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `63.96% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.

**UPDATE** By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes `62.48% - 64.93%` which suggests that this code set is well defined.
