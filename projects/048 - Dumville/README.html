<h1>Exploring rapid comparative evaluation of innovation using the GMCR: a case study on COVID Oximetry @home</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We want to explore if Greater Manchester Care Record data allows us to test how well changes in the NHS have worked quickly – so that we can feed information back to health services and patients rapidly.</p>
<p>To do this we want to find out what happened to people who used the COVID Oximetry@home approach in Greater Manchester and whether it made any differences to people’s care. This includes whether using the Oximetry@home service impacted whether people went to hospital more quickly, and then how long they stayed there. COVID Oximetry@home was offered to people with COVID in GM if they were over a certain age and had COVID with symptoms. Other people were also offered it if they were younger but were considered at higher risk of getting very ill from COVID. People offered access to this service were supported in monitoring their COVID at home and were supported to make decisions about whether they needed to come to hospital.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.</li>
<li>A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.</li>
<li>A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.</p>
<h2>Reusable queries</h2>
<p>This project required the following reusable queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>COVID vaccinations</li>
<li>Long-term condition groups per patient at an index date</li>
<li>undefined</li>
<li>Cohort matching on year of birth / sex / imd / and an index date</li>
<li>Index Multiple Deprivation</li>
<li>Lower level super output area</li>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Year of birth</li>
<li>Patients with COVID</li>
<li>Secondary admissions and length of stay</li>
<li>Secondary discharges</li>
<li>Classify secondary admissions</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details for each query can be found below.</p>
<h3>COVID vaccinations</h3>
<p>To obtain a table with first, second, third... etc vaccine doses per patient.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>GP records can often be duplicated. The assumption is that if a patient receives two vaccines within 14 days of each other then it is likely that both codes refer to the same vaccine.</li>
<li>The vaccine can appear as a procedure or as a medication. We assume that the presence of either represents a vaccination</li>
</ul>

<h3>Patients with COVID</h3>
<p>To get tables of all patients with a COVID diagnosis in their record. This now includes a table that has reinfections. This uses a 90 day cut-off to rule out patients that get multiple tests for a single infection. This 90 day cut-off is also used in the government COVID dashboard. In the first wave, prior to widespread COVID testing, and prior to the correct clinical codes being	available to clinicians, infections were recorded in a variety of ways. We therefore take the first diagnosis from any code indicative of COVID. However, for subsequent infections we insist on the presence of a positive COVID test (PCR or antigen) as opposed to simply a diagnosis code. This is to avoid the situation where a hospital diagnosis code gets entered into the primary care record several months after the actual infection.</p>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>Takes three parameters
  - start-date: string - (YYYY-MM-DD) the date to count diagnoses from. Usually this should be 2020-01-01.
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is &quot;SharedCare.GP_Events&quot; but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>Three temp tables as follows:
 #CovidPatients (FK_Patient_Link_ID, FirstCovidPositiveDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- FirstCovidPositiveDate - earliest COVID diagnosis
 #CovidPatientsAllDiagnoses (FK_Patient_Link_ID, CovidPositiveDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- CovidPositiveDate - any COVID diagnosis
 #CovidPatientsMultipleDiagnoses
	-	FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	-	FirstCovidPositiveDate - date of first COVID diagnosis
	-	SecondCovidPositiveDate - date of second COVID diagnosis
	-	ThirdCovidPositiveDate - date of third COVID diagnosis

<h3>Secondary admissions and length of stay</h3>
<p>To obtain a table with every secondary care admission, along with the acute provider, the date of admission, the date of discharge, and the length of stay.</p>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>One parameter
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>

<h3>Classify secondary admissions</h3>
<p>To categorise admissions to secondary care into 5 categories: Maternity, Unplanned, Planned, Transfer and Unknown.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We assume patients can only have one admission per day. This is probably not true, but where we see multiple admissions it is more likely to be data duplication, or internal admissions, than an admission, discharge and another admission in the same day.</li>
<li>Where patients have multiple admissions we choose the &quot;highest&quot; category for admission with the categories ranked as follows: Maternity &gt; Unplanned &gt; Planned &gt; Transfer &gt; Unknown</li>
<li>We have used the following classifications based on the AdmissionTypeCode:
<ul>
<li>PLANNED: PL (ELECTIVE PLANNED), 11 (Elective - Waiting List), WL (ELECTIVE WL), 13 (Elective - Planned), 12 (Elective - Booked), BL (ELECTIVE BOOKED), D (NULL), Endoscopy (Endoscopy), OP (DIRECT OUTPAT CLINIC), Venesection (X36.2 Venesection), Colonoscopy (H22.9 Colonoscopy), Medical (Medical)</li>
<li>UNPLANNED: AE (AE.DEPT.OF PROVIDER), 21 (Emergency - Local A&amp;E), I (NULL), GP (GP OR LOCUM GP), 22 (Emergency - GP), 23 (Emergency - Bed Bureau), 28 (Emergency - Other (inc other provider A&amp;E)), 2D (Emergency - Other), 24 (Emergency - Clinic), EM (EMERGENCY OTHER), AI (ACUTE TO INTMED CARE), BB (EMERGENCY BED BUREAU), DO (EMERGENCY DOMICILE), 2A (A+E Department of another provider where the Patient has not been admitted), A+E (Admission	 A+E Admission), Emerg (GP	Emergency GP Patient)</li>
<li>MATERNITY: 31 (Maternity ante-partum), BH (BABY BORN IN HOSP), AN (MATERNITY ANTENATAL), 82 (Birth in this Health Care Provider), PN (MATERNITY POST NATAL), B (NULL), 32 (Maternity post-partum), BHOSP (Birth in this Health Care Provider)</li>
<li>TRANSFER: 81 (Transfer from other hosp (not A&amp;E)), TR (PLAN TRANS TO TRUST), ET (EM TRAN (OTHER PROV)), HospTran (Transfer from other NHS Hospital), T (TRANSFER), CentTrans (Transfer from CEN Site)</li>
<li>OTHER: Anything else not previously classified</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Input</em></p>
<pre><code>No pre-requisites
</code></pre>
<p><em>Output</em></p>
<pre><code>A temp table as follows:
 #AdmissionTypes (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider, AdmissionType)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..

<h2>Clinical code sets</h2>
<p>This project required the following clinical code sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>covid-positive-antigen-test v1</li>
<li>covid-positive-pcr-test v1</li>
<li>covid-positive-test-other v1</li>
<li>covid-vaccination v1</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details for each code set can be found below.</p>
<h3>COVID-19 positive antigen test</h3>
<p>A code that indicates that a person has a positive antigen test for COVID-19.</p>
<h4>COVID positive tests in primary care</h4>
<p>The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets. However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of <code>covid-positive-antigen-test</code>, <code>covid-positive-pcr-test</code> and <code>covid-positive-test-other</code>.</p>
<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range <code>18.6% - 20.5%</code> suggests that this code set is likely well defined. <em>NB - this code set needs to rely on the SuppliedCode in the database rather than the foreign key ids.</em></p>

<h3>COVID-19 positive pcr test</h3>
<p>A code that indicates that a person has a positive pcr test for COVID-19.</p>
<h4>COVID positive tests in primary care</h4>
<p>The codes used in primary care to indicate a positive COVID test can be split into 3 types: antigen test, PCR test and other. We keep these as separate code sets. However due to the way that COVID diagnoses are recorded in different ways in different GP systems, and because some codes are ambiguous, currently it only makes sense to group these 3 code sets together. Therefore the prevalence log below is for the combined code sets of <code>covid-positive-antigen-test</code>, <code>covid-positive-pcr-test</code> and <code>covid-positive-test-other</code>.</p>
<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range <code>18.6% - 20.5%</code> suggests that this code set is likely well defined. <em>NB - this code set needs to rely on the SuppliedCode in the database rather than the foreign key ids.</em></p>

<h4>Prevalence log</h4>
<p>By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range <code>1.19% - 26.55%</code> as of 11th March 2021 is too wide. However the prevalence figure of 26.55% from EMIS is close to public data and is likely ok.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE - 25th March 2021</strong> Missing Read and CTV3 codes were added to the vaccination list and now the range of <code>26.91% - 32.96%</code> seems reasonable. It should be noted that there is an approx 2 week lag between events occurring and them being entered in the record.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE - 12th April 2021</strong>, latest prevalence figures.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE - 18th March 2022</strong> There are now new codes for things like 3rd/4th/booster dose of vaccine. The latest prevalence shows <code>65.0% - 66.3%</code> have at least one vaccine code in the GP_Events table, and <code>88.2% - 93.6%</code> have at least one code for the vaccine in the GP_Medications table.</p>
