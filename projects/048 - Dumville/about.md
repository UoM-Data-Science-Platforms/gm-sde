# Exploring rapid comparative evaluation of innovation using the GMCR: a case study on COVID Oximetry @home

## Summary

We want to explore if Greater Manchester Care Record data allows us to test how well changes in the NHS have worked quickly – so that we can feed information back to health services and patients rapidly.

To do this we want to find out what happened to people who used the COVID Oximetry@home approach in Greater Manchester and whether it made any differences to people’s care. This includes whether using the Oximetry@home service impacted whether people went to hospital more quickly, and then how long they stayed there. COVID Oximetry@home was offered to people with COVID in GM if they were over a certain age and had COVID with symptoms. Other people were also offered it if they were younger but were considered at higher risk of getting very ill from COVID. People offered access to this service were supported in monitoring their COVID at home and were supported to make decisions about whether they needed to come to hospital.
