- [Reusable queries](#reusable-queries)
- [Clinical code sets](#clinical-code-sets)

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- BMI
- Smoking status
- Lower level super output area
- Year of birth
- Index Multiple Deprivation
- Sex
- GET practice and ccg for each patient
- CCG lookup table
- Patient GP history
- Classify secondary admissions

Further details for each query can be found below.

### BMI
To get the BMI for each patient in a cohort.

_Assumptions_

- We take the measurement closest to @IndexDate to be correct

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
 Also takes one parameter:
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, FK_Reference_Coding_ID, and FK_Reference_SnomedCT_ID
 Also assumes there is an @IndexDate defined - The index date of the study
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientBMI (FK_Patient_Link_ID, BMI, DateOfBMIMeasurement)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
  - BMI
  - DateOfBMIMeasurement
```

---
### Smoking status
To get the smoking status for each patient in a cohort.

_Assumptions_

- We take the most recent smoking status in a patient's record to be correct
- However, there is likely confusion between the "non smoker" and "never smoked" codes. Especially as sometimes the synonyms for these codes overlap. Therefore, a patient wih a most recent smoking status of "never", but who has previous smoking codes, would be classed as WorstSmokingStatus=non-trivial-smoker / CurrentSmokingStatus=non-smoker

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
 Also takes one parameter:
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, FK_Reference_Coding_ID, and FK_Reference_SnomedCT_ID
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientSmokingStatus (FK_Patient_Link_ID, PassiveSmoker, WorstSmokingStatus, CurrentSmokingStatus)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- PassiveSmoker - Y/N (whether a patient has ever had a code for passive smoking)
	- WorstSmokingStatus - [non-trivial-smoker/trivial-smoker/non-smoker]
	- CurrentSmokingStatus - [non-trivial-smoker/trivial-smoker/non-smoker]
```

---
### Lower level super output area
To get the LSOA for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple LSOAs we determine the LSOA as follows:
- If the patients has an LSOA in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientLSOA (FK_Patient_Link_ID, LSOA)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- LSOA_Code - nationally recognised LSOA identifier
```

---
### Year of birth
To get the year of birth for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple YOBs we determine the YOB as follows:
- If the patients has a YOB in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every YOB for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated YOB in the database then we use that
- Otherwise we take the highest YOB for the patient that is not in the future

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort

---
### Sex
To get the Sex for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple sexes we determine the sex as follows:
- If the patients has a sex in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every sex for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated sex in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's sex is considered unknown

_Input_

### GET practice and ccg for each patient
For each patient to get the practice id that they are registered to, and the CCG name that the practice belongs to.

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
Two temp tables as follows:
 #PatientPractice (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- GPPracticeCode - the nationally recognised practice id for the patient
 #PatientPracticeAndCCG (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode, CCG)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- GPPracticeCode - the nationally recognised practice id for the patient
	- CCG - the name of the patient's CCG
```

---
### CCG lookup table
To provide lookup table for CCG names. The GMCR provides the CCG id (e.g. '00T', '01G') but not the CCG name. This table can be used in other queries when the output is required to be a ccg name rather than an id.

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #CCGLookup (CcgId, CcgName)
 	- CcgId - Nationally recognised ccg id
	- CcgName - Bolton, Stockport etc..
```
_File_: `query-ccg-lookup.sql`

---
### Patient GP history
To produce a table showing the start and end dates for each practice the patient has been registered at.

_Assumptions_

- We do not have data on patients who move out of GM, though we do know that it happened. For these patients we record the GPPracticeCode as OutOfArea
- Where two adjacent time periods either overlap, or have a gap between them, we assume that the most recent registration is more accurate and adjust the end date of the first time period accordingly. This is an infrequent occurrence.

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientGPHistory (FK_Patient_Link_ID, GPPracticeCode, StartDate, EndDate)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- GPPracticeCode - national GP practice id system
	- StartDate - date the patient registered at the practice
	- EndDate - date the patient left the practice
```

---
### Classify secondary admissions
To categorise admissions to secondary care into 5 categories: Maternity, Unplanned, Planned, Transfer and Unknown.

_Assumptions_

- We assume patients can only have one admission per day. This is probably not true, but where we see multiple admissions it is more likely to be data duplication, or internal admissions, than an admission, discharge and another admission in the same day.
- Where patients have multiple admissions we choose the "highest" category for admission with the categories ranked as follows: Maternity > Unplanned > Planned > Transfer > Unknown
- We have used the following classifications based on the AdmissionTypeCode:
	- PLANNED: PL (ELECTIVE PLANNED), 11 (Elective - Waiting List), WL (ELECTIVE WL), 13 (Elective - Planned), 12 (Elective - Booked), BL (ELECTIVE BOOKED), D (NULL), Endoscopy (Endoscopy), OP (DIRECT OUTPAT CLINIC), Venesection (X36.2 Venesection), Colonoscopy (H22.9 Colonoscopy), Medical (Medical)
	- UNPLANNED: AE (AE.DEPT.OF PROVIDER), 21 (Emergency - Local A&E), I (NULL), GP (GP OR LOCUM GP), 22 (Emergency - GP), 23 (Emergency - Bed Bureau), 28 (Emergency - Other (inc other provider A&E)), 2D (Emergency - Other), 24 (Emergency - Clinic), EM (EMERGENCY OTHER), AI (ACUTE TO INTMED CARE), BB (EMERGENCY BED BUREAU), DO (EMERGENCY DOMICILE), 2A (A+E Department of another provider where the Patient has not been admitted), A+E (Admission	 A+E Admission), Emerg (GP	Emergency GP Patient)
	- MATERNITY: 31 (Maternity ante-partum), BH (BABY BORN IN HOSP), AN (MATERNITY ANTENATAL), 82 (Birth in this Health Care Provider), PN (MATERNITY POST NATAL), B (NULL), 32 (Maternity post-partum), BHOSP (Birth in this Health Care Provider)
	- TRANSFER: 81 (Transfer from other hosp (not A&E)), TR (PLAN TRANS TO TRUST), ET (EM TRAN (OTHER PROV)), HospTran (Transfer from other NHS Hospital), T (TRANSFER), CentTrans (Transfer from CEN Site)
	- OTHER: Anything else not previously classified

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #AdmissionTypes (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider, AdmissionType)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
	- AdmissionType - One of: Maternity/Unplanned/Planned/Transfer/Unknown
```

## Clinical code sets

This project required the following clinical code sets:

- pregnancy v1
- smoking-status-current v1
- smoking-status-currently-not v1
- smoking-status-ex v1
- smoking-status-ex-trivial v1
- smoking-status-never v1
- smoking-status-passive v1
- smoking-status-trivial v1
- bmi v2

Further details for each code set can be found below.

### Pregnancy

Any codes indicating a patient is pregnant. Note that some of the codes in this code set are redacted from the GMCR due to sensitivity (e.g. abortion, unwanted pregnancy)

Code list provided by PI for RQ050.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `10.92% - 13.36%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2022-04-28 | EMIS            |  2661707   | 329135 (12.37%)  |  326253 (12.28%)  |
| 2022-04-28 | TPP             |  212737    |  23238 (10.92%)  |   23237 (10.92%)  |
| 2022-04-28 | Vision          |  342156    |  45729 (13.36%)  |   45622 (13.33%)  |

LINK: [https://github.com/rw251/.../patient/pregnancy/1](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/clinical-code-sets/patient/pregnancy/1)

### Smoking status current

Any code suggestive that a patient is a current smoker.

LINK: [https://github.com/rw251/.../patient/smoking-status-current/1](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/clinical-code-sets/patient/smoking-status-current/1)

### Smoking status currently not

Any code suggestive that a patient is currently a non-smoker. This is different to the "never smoked" code set.

LINK: [https://github.com/rw251/.../patient/smoking-status-currently-not/1](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/clinical-code-sets/patient/smoking-status-currently-not/1)

### Smoking status ex

Any code suggestive that a patient is an ex-smoker.

LINK: [https://github.com/rw251/.../patient/smoking-status-ex/1](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/clinical-code-sets/patient/smoking-status-ex/1)


LINK: [https://github.com/rw251/.../patient/smoking-status-ex-trivial/1](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/clinical-code-sets/patient/smoking-status-ex-trivial/1)

### Smoking status never

Any code suggestive that a patient has never smoked. This is different to the "currently not" code set.

LINK: [https://github.com/rw251/.../patient/smoking-status-never/1](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/clinical-code-sets/patient/smoking-status-never/1)


LINK: [https://github.com/rw251/.../patient/smoking-status-passive/1](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/clinical-code-sets/patient/smoking-status-passive/1)


LINK: [https://github.com/rw251/.../patient/smoking-status-trivial/1](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/clinical-code-sets/patient/smoking-status-trivial/1)

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `63.96% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.

**UPDATE** By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes `62.48% - 64.93%` which suggests that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-05-07 | EMIS            | 2605681    | 1709250 (65.60%) |  1709224 (65.60%) |
| 2021-05-07 | TPP             | 210817     |  134841 (63.96%) |   134835 (63.96%) |
