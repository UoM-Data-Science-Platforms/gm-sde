# Temporal trends in frequency of mental illness diagnoses and self-harm episodes recorded in primary care in children, adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: Time series analysis of electronic healthcare records patients in the Greater Manchester Care Record (GMCR)

## Summary

Mental illness is one of the leading causes of ill-health in the UK. As such, child and adolescent psychological health is now recognised as being a major public health priority, which has led to a greater understanding of these conditions and how it affects individuals.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the mental health of the population and there is a need to identify gaps of/access to health care services. There are concerns that the pandemic could widen pre-existing inequalities, and also around how children and adolescents have been affected by school closures and other opportunities to interact socially with their peers.  Differences in how lockdown has impacted upon students and young adults is likely to differ with many experiencing difficulties in trying to keep up with schoolwork at home. In the early phase of the pandemic, the public were also asked to avoid attending health facilities, including general practices, to help control the virus.  This might have led to fewer people seeing their GPs and other clinicians even if they were experiencing mental health difficulties.

We aim to use GMCR data to provide information on the numbers of children, adolescents and young adults seeking help for mental health problems during the pandemic and how these differ by age, gender, ethnicity, and locality, and how youngsters living in deprived places may differ from those in more affluent areas. It is hoped this will help us to better understand issues of concern in healthcare services and which groups of people may need more help.

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Create counting tables for each medications based on GPMedications table - RQ051
- Create counting tables for each conditions based on GPEvents table - RQ051
- GET practice and ccg for each patient
- Year of birth
- Index Multiple Deprivation
- Sex
- CCG lookup table

Further details for each query can be found below.

---
### Year of birth
To get the year of birth for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple YOBs we determine the YOB as follows:
- If the patients has a YOB in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every YOB for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated YOB in the database then we use that
- Otherwise we take the highest YOB for the patient that is not in the future

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)

### Sex
To get the Sex for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple sexes we determine the sex as follows:
- If the patients has a sex in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every sex for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated sex in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's sex is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)

---
### CCG lookup table
To provide lookup table for CCG names. The GMCR provides the CCG id (e.g. '00T', '01G') but not the CCG name. This table can be used in other queries when the output is required to be a ccg name rather than an id.

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #CCGLookup (CcgId, CcgName)

### Anxiety

Any code indicating a diagnosis of anxiety or other somatoform disorder. Developed from SNOMED searches and the opencodelist code set: https://www.opencodelists.org/codelist/opensafely/anxiety-disorders/6aef605a/.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `21.3% - 22%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### Depression

Code set for patients with a diagnosis of depression.

Developed from www.opencodelists.org

- Seasonal affective disorder included as that is a depressive condition
- Includes non-diagnosis codes such as monitoring invites
- Codes indicating grief from bereavement or other life events are included on the grounds that if they are coded in a person's record they are likely clinically important

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system,
we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

This code set was created from getset.ga.

- Includes codes suggesting ADHD such as monitoring letters and annual reviews
- Does not include ADHD assessment scales
- Includes attention deficit disorder (i.e. without hyperactivity). This might not be what you want.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions.

- Includes "suspected autism" codes. This might not be what you want.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.17 - 1.28%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### Other antidepressants

This code set was created as the union of the following drugs as specified from the PI of RQ051:

- Agomelatine
- Bupropion

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.73 - 0.85%` for EMIS and Vision practices suggests this is well defined. However TPP practices have a rate of `1.4%`, nearly double that of EMIS and Vision, suggesting extra prescribing in those practices. TPP has the smallest footprint in terms of patient numbers which may also be a contributing factor.
