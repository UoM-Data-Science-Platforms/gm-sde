# Temporal trends in frequency of mental illness diagnoses and self-harm episodes recorded in primary care in children, adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: Time series analysis of electronic healthcare records patients in the Greater Manchester Care Record (GMCR)

## Summary

Mental illness is one of the leading causes of ill-health in the UK. As such, child and adolescent psychological health is now recognised as being a major public health priority, which has led to a greater understanding of these conditions and how it affects individuals.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the mental health of the population and there is a need to identify gaps of/access to health care services. There are concerns that the pandemic could widen pre-existing inequalities, and also around how children and adolescents have been affected by school closures and other opportunities to interact socially with their peers.  Differences in how lockdown has impacted upon students and young adults is likely to differ with many experiencing difficulties in trying to keep up with schoolwork at home. In the early phase of the pandemic, the public were also asked to avoid attending health facilities, including general practices, to help control the virus.  This might have led to fewer people seeing their GPs and other clinicians even if they were experiencing mental health difficulties.

We aim to use GMCR data to provide information on the numbers of children, adolescents and young adults seeking help for mental health problems during the pandemic and how these differ by age, gender, ethnicity, and locality, and how youngsters living in deprived places may differ from those in more affluent areas. It is hoped this will help us to better understand issues of concern in healthcare services and which groups of people may need more help.
