- [Clinical code sets](#clinical-code-sets)

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Care home status
- Patient GP encounters
- Lower level super output area
- Index Multiple Deprivation
- Sex
- Secondary admissions and length of stay
- Secondary discharges
- Create listing tables for each GP events - RQ062
- Define Cohort for RQ062: all individuals registered with a GP who were aged 50 years or older on September 1 2013
- Year and quarter month of birth
- GET practice and ccg for each patient
- CCG lookup table
- Create table of patients who are registered with a GM GP

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Care home status
To get the care home status for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- If any of the patient records suggests the patients lives in a care home we will assume that they do

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientCareHomeStatus (FK_Patient_Link_ID, IsCareHomeResident)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- IsCareHomeResident - Y/N
```

---
### Patient GP encounters
To produce a table of GP encounters for a list of patients. This script uses many codes related to observations (e.g. blood pressure), symptoms, and diagnoses, to infer when GP encounters occured. This script includes face to face and telephone encounters - it will need copying and editing if you don't require both.

_Assumptions_

- multiple codes on the same day will be classed as one encounter (so max daily encounters per patient is 1)

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #GPEncounters (FK_Patient_Link_ID, EncounterDate)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- EncounterDate - date the patient had a GP encounter
```

---
### Lower level super output area
To get the LSOA for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple LSOAs we determine the LSOA as follows:
- If the patients has an LSOA in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientLSOA (FK_Patient_Link_ID, LSOA)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- LSOA_Code - nationally recognised LSOA identifier
```

 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientIMDDecile (FK_Patient_Link_ID, IMD2019Decile1IsMostDeprived10IsLeastDeprived)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- IMD2019Decile1IsMostDeprived10IsLeastDeprived - number 1 to 10 inclusive

---
### Sex
To get the Sex for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple sexes we determine the sex as follows:
- If the patients has a sex in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every sex for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated sex in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's sex is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)

### Secondary admissions and length of stay
To obtain a table with every secondary care admission, along with the acute provider, the date of admission, the date of discharge, and the length of stay.

_Input_
```
One parameter
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
```

_Output_
```
Two temp table as follows:
 #Admissions (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
  (Limited to one admission per person per hospital per day, because if a patient has 2 admissions
   on the same day to the same hopsital then it's most likely data duplication rather than two short
   hospital stays)
 #LengthOfStay (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `27.3% - 32.4%` suggests this code set is well defined.
