# Improving the monitoring and treatment of hypothyroidism

## Summary

Primary hypothyroidism affects about 3% of the general population. In most cases patients are treated with Levothyroxine at a suitable dose. The most recent British Thyroid Association guidance provides advice on the use of levothyroxine, NDT and liothyronine to achieve both symptomatic relief and euthyroid levels in the blood. There are risks associated with higher doses than necessary of thyroid hormones, while continuing symptoms can diminish quality of life substantially.

Levels of thyroid hormones including Free Thyroxine (FT4), Free Thyronine (FT3), and thyroid suppressing hormone (TSH) in the blood vary a number of factors including age, sex, duration with condition, deprivation and ethnicity. Patients have their thyroid hormone levels tested both for diagnostic ie not currently on thyroid hormone treatment and for monitoring to ensure when on thyroid hormone treatment that the treatment is delivering the required hormone levels in the blood. Comparing the laboratory results for those being treated by medication dose to those untreated of similar age and sex, will provide insight into the difference being achieved in the treated population vs the untreated population with a view to adjusting clinical recommendations so that thyroid hormone replacement can be as physiological as possible. Age and sex standardised all cause mortality can also be used to establish the difference in outcomes between the treated, untreated and general population.

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Get all events for RQ065 cohort - but only the suppliedcode and date
- GET practice and ccg for each patient
- CCG lookup table

- If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown

_Input_

## Clinical code sets

This project required the following clinical code sets:

- t4 v1
- tsh v1
- t3 v1
- tpo-antibody v1
- bmi v2
- levothyroxine v1
- liothyronine v1
- hypothyroidism v1
- thyroid-disorders v1

Further details for each code set can be found below.

### T4 (Thyroxine) test

Codes for a "Free T4" level test. Only includes codes that will have a value, i.e. not codes such as "T4 normal" which indicate the result without a numeric value.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `27.1 - 38.7%` suggests that the code set is not complete. Either there are missing codes, or the way that T4 is recorded in practice systems differs in some way. E.g. if a GP requests TSH from a thyroid function test, then T4 will also be calculated, but if not explicitly requested it may not have automatically been entered into the record.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2023-12-21 | EMIS            | 2516480    |   974896 (38.7%) |    975076 (38.7%) |
| 2023-12-21 | TPP             | 201282     |    55648 (27.6%) |     55658 (27.7%) |
| 2023-12-21 | Vision          | 334130     |    90417 (27.1%) |     90434 (27.1%) |

### TSH level (thyroid-stimulating hormone)

Codes for a TSH level test. Only includes codes that will have a value, i.e. not codes such as "TSH normal" which indicate the result without a numeric value. SNOMED codes taken from https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/ and then mapped to Readv2 and CTV3 for backward compatibility.

Excludes

- "30/60/90/etc minute plasma thyroid stimulating hormone level".
- TSH in blood spot as this is for newborns
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `55 - 56.7%` for EMIS and Vision suggests that this code set is likely well defined. TPP slightly higher.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2023-12-21 | EMIS            | 2516480    |    1384385 (55%) |     1384512 (55%) |

### T3 (Triiodothyronine) test

Codes for a "Free T3" level test. Only includes codes that will have a value, i.e. not codes such as "T3 normal" which indicate the result without a numeric value.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.44 - 1.91%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined. NB T3 is not part of the standard thyroid function test in the UK and so it's prevalence is a lot lower than T4.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2023-12-21 | EMIS            | 2516480    |    37279 (1.48%) |     37298 (1.48%) |

### TPO antibody (thyroid peroxidase antibody test)

Codes for a TPO antibody test. Only includes codes that will have a value, i.e. not codes such as "normal" which indicate the result without a numeric value. SNOMED codes taken from https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/ and then mapped to Readv2 and CTV3 for backward compatibility.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.33 - 1.41%` for EMIS and Vision suggests that this code set is likely well defined. TPP slightly lower.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2023-12-21 | EMIS            | 2516480    |    35471 (1.41%) |     35489 (1.41%) |

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `63.96% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.

**UPDATE** By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes `62.48% - 64.93%` which suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2023/11/01**: prevalence now `61.2% - 65.7%` for EMIS and VISION. TPP higher at 73%._

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `3.3% - 3.4%` for EMIS and Vision practices suggests this code set is well defined. TPP is slightly higher at `4.3%`.

- Does not include "goitre" unless code explicitly relates it to hypothyroidism
- Does not include "hypopituitarism" or "pituitary hypofunction" as these relate to a hormone deficiency in the pituitary gland, but TSH is just one of the hormones that it could refer to
- Does not include neonatal codes e.g. neonatal hypothyroidism, or thyroid aplasia
- Does include post-surgical and other transient hypothyroidism
- Does include hypothyrotropinaemia and hypothyroxinemia
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `3-4%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
