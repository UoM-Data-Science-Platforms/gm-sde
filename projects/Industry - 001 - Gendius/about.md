# Evaluating the risk of undiagnosed CKD amongst people with type 2 diabetes within Greater Manchester

## Summary

We will use the secure data environment to study the current CKD diagnosis pathway for people living with type 2 diabetes and to evaluate the risk of undiagnosed CKD. To evaluate the pathway, we will look at the adherence to guidelines with respect to testing frequency and follow-up actions. For evaluating risk, we will apply an algorithm to data captured within the health record to estimate the risk that a person has kidney dysfunction. The feasibility of the application of this algorithm will be assessed by reporting the proportion of patients that do not have enough information to assess the risk. We will then identify practices that may benefit from the risk calculation by evaluating the volume of patients at high risk.
