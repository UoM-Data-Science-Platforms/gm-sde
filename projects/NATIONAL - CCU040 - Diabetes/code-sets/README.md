# Code sets

All code sets are derived from the definition of the GDPPR data feeds (available at https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/gpes-data-for-pandemic-planning-and-research/guide-for-analysts-and-users-of-the-data). They therefore might not be complete and should be used with non-GDPPR data cautiously. However, as these codes have come from the definition for GDPPR, we can be reasonably confident that all available codes are captured.
