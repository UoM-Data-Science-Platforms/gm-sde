# LSOA

**Desciption** To get the LSOA for each patient

## Notes

For each patient we attempt to determine their LSOA as at the date provided. This currently only uses the GDPPR feed and could be extended
to use other sources of data. For each patient we find their most recent record with an LSOA, prior to the date of interest. If the patient has
no record prior to the date, then we find their most recent one after the date. This will then give an LSOA for patients who did not have a record
prior to the date.

If someone has multiple records on the same day, we arbitrarily pick the one with the code latest alphabetically. This could be improved, but
will not occur frequently, so is deemed acceptable.

## Input
**date** In the form YYYY-MM-DD

## Output
**Table name** global_temp.CCU040_LSOA

| Column    | Type   | Description       |
| ----------| ------ | ----------------- |
| PatientId | string | Unique patient id |
| LSOA      | string | The patients LSOA |
