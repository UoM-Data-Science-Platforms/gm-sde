- [Clinical code sets](#clinical-code-sets)

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- This file loads whichever code set is specified, and inserts into a permanent snowflake table
- Classify secondary admissions
- Secondary admissions and length of stay
- Secondary discharges
- Define Cohort for LH001: patients that had pharmacogenetic testing, and matched controls

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Classify secondary admissions
To categorise admissions to secondary care into 5 categories: Maternity, Unplanned, Planned, Transfer and Unknown.

_Assumptions_

- We assume patients can only have one admission per day. This is probably not true, but where we see multiple admissions it is more likely to be data duplication, or internal admissions, than an admission, discharge and another admission in the same day.
- Where patients have multiple admissions we choose the "highest" category for admission with the categories ranked as follows: Maternity > Unplanned > Planned > Transfer > Unknown
- We have used the following classifications based on the AdmissionTypeCode:
	- PLANNED: PL (ELECTIVE PLANNED), 11 (Elective - Waiting List), WL (ELECTIVE WL), 13 (Elective - Planned), 12 (Elective - Booked), BL (ELECTIVE BOOKED), D (NULL), Endoscopy (Endoscopy), OP (DIRECT OUTPAT CLINIC), Venesection (X36.2 Venesection), Colonoscopy (H22.9 Colonoscopy), Medical (Medical)
	- UNPLANNED: AE (AE.DEPT.OF PROVIDER), 21 (Emergency - Local A&E), I (NULL), GP (GP OR LOCUM GP), 22 (Emergency - GP), 23 (Emergency - Bed Bureau), 28 (Emergency - Other (inc other provider A&E)), 2D (Emergency - Other), 24 (Emergency - Clinic), EM (EMERGENCY OTHER), AI (ACUTE TO INTMED CARE), BB (EMERGENCY BED BUREAU), DO (EMERGENCY DOMICILE), 2A (A+E Department of another provider where the Patient has not been admitted), A+E (Admission	 A+E Admission), Emerg (GP	Emergency GP Patient)
	- MATERNITY: 31 (Maternity ante-partum), BH (BABY BORN IN HOSP), AN (MATERNITY ANTENATAL), 82 (Birth in this Health Care Provider), PN (MATERNITY POST NATAL), B (NULL), 32 (Maternity post-partum), BHOSP (Birth in this Health Care Provider)
	- TRANSFER: 81 (Transfer from other hosp (not A&E)), TR (PLAN TRANS TO TRUST), ET (EM TRAN (OTHER PROV)), HospTran (Transfer from other NHS Hospital), T (TRANSFER), CentTrans (Transfer from CEN Site)
	- OTHER: Anything else not previously classified

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #AdmissionTypes (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider, AdmissionType)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
	- AdmissionType - One of: Maternity/Unplanned/Planned/Transfer/Unknown

### Secondary admissions and length of stay
To obtain a table with every secondary care admission, along with the acute provider, the date of admission, the date of discharge, and the length of stay.

_Input_
```
One parameter
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
```

_Output_
```
Two temp table as follows:
 #Admissions (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
  (Limited to one admission per person per hospital per day, because if a patient has 2 admissions
   on the same day to the same hopsital then it's most likely data duplication rather than two short
   hospital stays)
 #LengthOfStay (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
	- DischargeDate - date of discharge (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- LengthOfStay - Number of days between admission and discharge. 1 = [0,1) days, 2 = [1,2) days, etc.
```

### Secondary discharges
To obtain a table with every secondary care discharge, along with the acute provider, and the date of discharge.

_Input_
```
One parameter
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #Discharges (FK_Patient_Link_ID, DischargeDate, AcuteProvider)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- DischargeDate - date of discharge (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
  (Limited to one discharge per person per hospital per day, because if a patient has 2 discharges
   on the same day to the same hopsital then it's most likely data duplication rather than two short
   hospital stays)

### Define Cohort for LH001: patients that had pharmacogenetic testing, and matched controls
To build the cohort of patients needed for LH001. This reduces duplication of code in the template scripts.

_Input_
```
undefined
```

_Output_
```
Temp tables as follows:
 Cohort
```
_File_: `query-build-lh001-cohort.sql`

## Clinical code sets

This project required the following clinical code sets:

- surgery-referral v1

Further details for each code set can be found below.

### Surgery

Any code indicating referral to surgery.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.22% - 4.46%` suggests a potential overreporting from TPP practices.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2024-04-12 | EMIS | 2528955 | 30968 (1.22%) | 30463 (1.2%) | 
| 2024-04-12 | TPP | 201791 | 9008 (4.46%) | 8967 (4.44%) | 
| 2024-04-12 | Vision | 335318 | 5040 (1.5%) | 5013 (1.49%) |
