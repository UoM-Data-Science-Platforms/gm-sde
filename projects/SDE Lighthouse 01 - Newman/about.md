# Establishing the clinical utility of pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing across Greater Manchester using linked data

## Summary

Not everyone responds the same way to medicines. Some people develop side effects, some don’t respond at all, whereas others might respond well. This variability is very common and can be challenging for patients and healthcare professionals. There are lots of reasons for this variability, but one factor could be related to an individual’s genetics; a concept known as pharmacogenetics. Manchester is an international leader for pharmacogenetics research. Two major trials taking place at the moment are known as IPTIP and PROGRESS. IPTIP aims to understand how pharmacogenetics might be used in Hospitals whilst PROGRESS aims to develop a pharmacogenetic testing service in primary care. We’ve developed a video which explains a little more about how this works (https://tinyurl.com/mr37vmeu)

Using the secure data environment (SDE) we aim to create a dataset from patients in the PROGRESS and IPTIP trials. With their consent, we plan to gather information on their medications, hospital admissions, and health outcomes over time. The objectives include setting up a sample dataset, anonymizing and adding genetic data to the SDE. We will then compare medication use and outcomes with a control group for specific medications. Finally, by collaborating with a health economics centre, we will assess the cost and benefits of using genetic information to optimize medication choices. 

We are committed to developing an equitable service for all; therefore we are recruiting from a diverse range of practices across Manchester and our inclusion criteria are purposefully broad. Any adult patient being considered for one of four medicines (statins, two types of antidepressants, and proton pump inhibitors) are eligible for recruitment.
