## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Index Multiple Deprivation
- Lower level super output area
- Sex
- Patient GP encounters
- Long-term conditions and comorbidities
- Define Cohort for LH003: patients that had a dementia diagnosis
- Year of birth
- Create table of patients who are registered with a GM GP

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Index Multiple Deprivation

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientIMDDecile (FK_Patient_Link_ID, IMD2019Decile1IsMostDeprived10IsLeastDeprived)

---
### Lower level super output area
To get the LSOA for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple LSOAs we determine the LSOA as follows:
- If the patients has an LSOA in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientLSOA (FK_Patient_Link_ID, LSOA)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- LSOA_Code - nationally recognised LSOA identifier
```

---
### Sex
To get the Sex for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple sexes we determine the sex as follows:
- If the patients has a sex in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every sex for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated sex in the database then we use that
- Otherwise the patient's sex is considered unknown

_Input_
```

---
### Patient GP encounters
To produce a table of GP encounters for a list of patients. This script uses many codes related to observations (e.g. blood pressure), symptoms, and diagnoses, to infer when GP encounters occured. This script includes face to face and telephone encounters - it will need copying and editing if you don't require both.

_Assumptions_

- multiple codes on the same day will be classed as one encounter (so max daily encounters per patient is 1)

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #GPEncounters (FK_Patient_Link_ID, EncounterDate)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- EncounterDate - date the patient had a GP encounter
```
_File_: `query-patient-gp-encounters.sql`

---
### Long-term conditions and comorbidities
To get long-term conditions for each patient within a date range.

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
 A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
 @IndexDate - The index date of the study
 @MinDate - The minimum date that the study has access from
```

_Output_
```
A temp table with a row for each patient and ltc combo
 #PatientsWithLTCs
   FK_Patient_Link_ID,
   Condition,
   FirstDate,
   LastDate
```

---
### Define Cohort for LH003: patients that had a dementia diagnosis
To build the cohort of patients needed for LH003. This reduces duplication of code in the template scripts.

_Input_
```
assumes there exists one temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
Temp tables as follows:
 #Cohort
```

---
### Year of birth
To get the year of birth for each patient.

_Assumptions_

- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple YOBs we determine the YOB as follows:
- If the patients has a YOB in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
- If every YOB for a patient is the same, then we use that
- If there is a single most recently updated YOB in the database then we use that
- Otherwise we take the highest YOB for the patient that is not in the future

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientYearOfBirth (FK_Patient_Link_ID, YearOfBirth)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id

### Dementia

Any code indicating that a person has dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.

Code set from https://www.opencodelists.org/codelist/opensafely/dementia-complete/48c76cf8/
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.67% - 0.81%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2022-12-20 | EMIS            | 2438146    |   19770 (0.811%) |    21772 (0.893%) |
| 2022-12-20 | TPP             | 198637     |    1427 (0.718%) |      7445 (3.75%) |
| 2022-12-20 | Vision          | 327196     |    2244 (0.686%) |     2265 (0.692%) |

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `63.96% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.

**UPDATE** By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes `62.48% - 64.93%` which suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2023/11/01**: prevalence now `61.2% - 65.7%` for EMIS and VISION. TPP higher at 73%._

### Smoking status

Any indication that a smoking status has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's smoking status (`1378. - Ex-light smoker (1-9/day)`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`137.. - Tobacco consumption`).

Smoking status codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a smoking status has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's smoking status then this is not the code set for you.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions.
