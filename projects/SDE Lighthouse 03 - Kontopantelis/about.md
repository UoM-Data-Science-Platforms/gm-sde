# Understanding and addressing socio-economic inequality within the quality and safety of care and clinical outcomes for people living with dementia

## Summary

In the coming years, many more people will develop dementia (severe memory problems which affect day-to-day life). It is recommended that after diagnosis, care for people with dementia should mainly be community based, provided by the primary care team. There are recommendations for care that should be provided, ensuring it is high-quality and safe. These recommendations include an annual review, regular medication reviews, care planning and safe prescribing of medications. Few studies have looked at how recommended primary care processes and key outcomes, vary with socio-economic factors for people with dementia. Those that have, found evidence of inequalities in care and outcomes. The study's aim is to explore how post-diagnosis primary care and important outcomes for people with dementia vary with socio-economic factors and other markers of health disadvantage.

Data from the Greater Manchester Secure Data Environment (GM SDE) containing anonymised records for people with dementia, aged >18 years or older, diagnosed from 2020 onwards for comparative outcome analyses.

We will analyse how 'care processes' (including yearly reviews, carer reviews, care planning, medication prescribing) and 'outcomes' (including emergency hospital admissions, falls, fractures) vary with socio-economic factors. These factors will include the patient's socioeconomic status as measured by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD, which summarises the level of deprivation of where the patients live), as well as other markers of health disadvantage including ethnicity, sex, rural/urban practice location and disabilities.

The results will evidence how care provided and important outcomes for people with dementia vary with the described socio-economic factors. Results will contribute to guidelines
