# General

- Consider how this will work in the future because we dont want to rebuild the cohort in every template.sql file
- In each file, rather than SELECT at the end, we probably want to INSERT into another permanent table

# 1.patients.template.sql

- Change the "GmPseudo IN..." to pull from the table created in the build cohort script
- Add IMD - likely select distinct "Effective_Snapshot_Date" from SHARED_UK_FACTS_AND_DIMENSIONS_VIEWS."Demography"."fact_Index_Of_Multiple_Deprivation_By_LSOA"
- Add date of death - likely from PRESENTATION.NATIONAL_FLOWS_PCMD."DS1804_Pcmd"

# 2.lifestyle.template.sql

- Maybe check with PI that they're happy with the output format

# 3.comorbidities.template.sql

- Need to define all the comorbidities
- LongTermCon.. table in GP_Record does the first occurrence, but not the last or the number

# 4.outcomes.template.sql

- We have:
  - Dementia care plan reviews
  - Medication reviews (including structured and dementia)
  - Referral to social prescribing
- Still need (check with PI):
  - advance care planning
  - continuity of care measures
  - carer type
  - carer review
  - social care referrals
  - safeguarding referrals
  - frequency of attendance
  - missed appointments
  - All-cause mortality
  - unscheduled hospital admissions
  - delirium
  - falls
  - fractures.

# 5.medications.template.sql

- We have:
  - antipsychotics
  - benzodiazepines and z-drugs (in one code set - ok?)
- Still need:
  - anti-dementia meds
  - anticholinergics
  - sedating antihistamines
