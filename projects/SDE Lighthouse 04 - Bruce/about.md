# Health Outcomes in systemic Lupus erythematosus and their Determinants across Greater Manchester (HOLD-GM)

## Summary

Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that frequently affects younger women in their child-bearing years. It affects ~100 per 100,000 of the UK population and patients of non-White ethnicity are most likely to have lupus and also to suffer severe disease. Previous UK studies of lupus are not representative of the social and ethnic diversity in Greater Manchester.

Lupus is a good example of how a number of other long-term conditions can develop in a population and the impact that the disease, treatment and social factors can have on their development. One third of lupus patients will have kidney involvement and this impacts on life expectancy. Cardiovascular disease and infections contribute to morbidity and are leading causes of death in lupus. Pregnancy in lupus is also more likely to result in complications for both mother and child.

We plan to establish a Greater Manchester-wide cohort of lupus patients (HOLD-GM) to examine the rates of kidney and cardiovascular disease, infections and vaccination uptake, and pregnancy outcomes. This will map out important healthcare needs of lupus patients so that services can be improved in the right location and areas for the most important further research can be identified.

## Notes

- Infections are split into two tables

  - `LH004-4.infections-gp`

    Includes any infection recorded in the GP record.

  - `LH004-4.infections-hospital`

    Includes any hospital stay were an infection was given as the primary cause of admission.

- The `LH004-6.smears` table contains any code relating to a smear test and will need further refining.
- Mortality information was requested as a separate data table, however it is provided in the main demographic table `LH004-1.patients`
