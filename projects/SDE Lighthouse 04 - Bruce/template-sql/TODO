# General

- Send SLE code set to double check


# 1.patients

- Asked for quartile, is decile ok for IMD (can then choose decile or quintile)

# medications

- would format of PatientId, Date, MedicationCategory, Medication, Dose work instead?
- means you could quickly work out y/n in last 3 months or before last 3 months
- could also calculate "dose" in different ways?
- would allow the different statins, acei etc to be represented better
