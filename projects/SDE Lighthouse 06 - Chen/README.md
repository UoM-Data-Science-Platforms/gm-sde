## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Define Cohort for LH006: patients that had multiple opioid prescriptions

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Define Cohort for LH006: patients that had multiple opioid prescriptions
To build the cohort of patients needed for LH006. This reduces duplication of code in the template scripts.

_Input_
```

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `57.8% - 60.6%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### Neuropathic pain

Neuropathic pain is nerve pain that can happen if your nervous system malfunctions or gets damaged. You can feel pain from any of the various levels of your nervous system, including your peripheral nerves, your spinal cord and your brain. Damaged nerve fibers send the wrong signals to pain centers in your body, resulting in neuropathic pain.

### Social care prescribing referral

Codes indicating that patient had a referral to social care prescribing services. Created using getset:

{
  "includeTerms": [
    "referral to physical activity programme",
    "referral to weight management programme",
    "referral to social prescribing"
  ],
  "excludeTerms": [
    "declined"
  ],
  "terminology": "SNOMED CT",
  "version": "uk_sct2cl_29.3.0_20200610000001",
  "createdOn": "2023-11-30T11:43:13.806Z",

}

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.6% - 4.41%` suggests code set is potentially missing codes used by Vision practices.


| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2023-11-30 | EMIS | 2514435 | 88101 (3.5%) | 88111 (3.5%) | 
| 2023-11-30 | TPP | 201265 | 8863 (4.4%) | 8867 (4.41%) |

### Surgery

Any code indicating referral to surgery.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.22% - 4.46%` suggests a potential overreporting from TPP practices.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2024-04-12 | EMIS | 2528955 | 30968 (1.22%) | 30463 (1.2%) | 
| 2024-04-12 | TPP | 201791 | 9008 (4.46%) | 8967 (4.44%) |
