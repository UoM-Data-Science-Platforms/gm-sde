## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Classify secondary admissions
- Secondary admissions and length of stay
- Secondary discharges
- Define Cohort for LH006: patients that had multiple opioid prescriptions

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Classify secondary admissions
To categorise admissions to secondary care into 5 categories: Maternity, Unplanned, Planned, Transfer and Unknown.

_Assumptions_

- We assume patients can only have one admission per day. This is probably not true, but where we see multiple admissions it is more likely to be data duplication, or internal admissions, than an admission, discharge and another admission in the same day.
- Where patients have multiple admissions we choose the "highest" category for admission with the categories ranked as follows: Maternity > Unplanned > Planned > Transfer > Unknown
- We have used the following classifications based on the AdmissionTypeCode:
	- PLANNED: PL (ELECTIVE PLANNED), 11 (Elective - Waiting List), WL (ELECTIVE WL), 13 (Elective - Planned), 12 (Elective - Booked), BL (ELECTIVE BOOKED), D (NULL), Endoscopy (Endoscopy), OP (DIRECT OUTPAT CLINIC), Venesection (X36.2 Venesection), Colonoscopy (H22.9 Colonoscopy), Medical (Medical)
	- UNPLANNED: AE (AE.DEPT.OF PROVIDER), 21 (Emergency - Local A&E), I (NULL), GP (GP OR LOCUM GP), 22 (Emergency - GP), 23 (Emergency - Bed Bureau), 28 (Emergency - Other (inc other provider A&E)), 2D (Emergency - Other), 24 (Emergency - Clinic), EM (EMERGENCY OTHER), AI (ACUTE TO INTMED CARE), BB (EMERGENCY BED BUREAU), DO (EMERGENCY DOMICILE), 2A (A+E Department of another provider where the Patient has not been admitted), A+E (Admission	 A+E Admission), Emerg (GP	Emergency GP Patient)
	- MATERNITY: 31 (Maternity ante-partum), BH (BABY BORN IN HOSP), AN (MATERNITY ANTENATAL), 82 (Birth in this Health Care Provider), PN (MATERNITY POST NATAL), B (NULL), 32 (Maternity post-partum), BHOSP (Birth in this Health Care Provider)
	- TRANSFER: 81 (Transfer from other hosp (not A&E)), TR (PLAN TRANS TO TRUST), ET (EM TRAN (OTHER PROV)), HospTran (Transfer from other NHS Hospital), T (TRANSFER), CentTrans (Transfer from CEN Site)
	- OTHER: Anything else not previously classified

_Input_
```
No pre-requisites
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #AdmissionTypes (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider, AdmissionType)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
	- AdmissionType - One of: Maternity/Unplanned/Planned/Transfer/Unknown

---
### Secondary admissions and length of stay
To obtain a table with every secondary care admission, along with the acute provider, the date of admission, the date of discharge, and the length of stay.

_Input_
```
One parameter
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
```

_Output_
```
Two temp table as follows:
 #Admissions (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate, AcuteProvider)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
  (Limited to one admission per person per hospital per day, because if a patient has 2 admissions
   on the same day to the same hopsital then it's most likely data duplication rather than two short
   hospital stays)
 #LengthOfStay (FK_Patient_Link_ID, AdmissionDate)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- AdmissionDate - date of admission (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
	- DischargeDate - date of discharge (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- LengthOfStay - Number of days between admission and discharge. 1 = [0,1) days, 2 = [1,2) days, etc.
```

### Secondary discharges
To obtain a table with every secondary care discharge, along with the acute provider, and the date of discharge.

_Input_
```
One parameter
	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #Discharges (FK_Patient_Link_ID, DischargeDate, AcuteProvider)
 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- DischargeDate - date of discharge (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- AcuteProvider - Bolton, SRFT, Stockport etc..
  (Limited to one discharge per person per hospital per day, because if a patient has 2 discharges
   on the same day to the same hopsital then it's most likely data duplication rather than two short

CTV3 and SNOMED code sets from OpenSafely.

ICD10 codes have been provided and verified by the Christie team (004). 
#### Prevalence log
By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set, as of 19th July 2021.

### Chronic Pain

SNOMED and Read codes from study team for SDE-LS-006, used in previous CPRD studies.

EMIS and CTV3 codes retrieved from reference lookup in Graphnet database.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `57.9% - 60.4%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) oral

This code set was originally created for the SMASH safe medication dashboard and has been validated in practice.

This code set only includes codes that indicates oral NSAIDs. It does not include codes that indicate cream or suppository NSAIDs.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate only oral NSAIDs, NOT all NSAIDs. If you require all NSAIDs then this is not the code set for you.**
