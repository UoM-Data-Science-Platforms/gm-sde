# Long-term opioid utilisation patterns and associated adverse consequences in patients with chronic-non cancer pain in Greater Manchester

## Summary

The surge in opioid prescriptions in patients with chronic pain has sparked concerns about potential overdoses, misuse, and fatalities. Our prior research unearthed a link between opioid use and socioeconomic status, revealing Manchester has the highest usage of opioids among all of England's metropolitan cities. In response to these challenges, our current study investigates the intricate landscape of opioid use, aiming to understand long-term utilisation patterns and suggest strategies to prevent opioid-related harm while enhancing chronic pain care. 

Despite existing guidelines and local strategies to optimise opioid use, there is a conspicuous absence of a national consensus on safely reducing opioid dependence. Moreover, there is a lack of non-pharmacological strategies available for chronic pain management. Consequently, addressing safety concerns related to problematic opioid use, including high-dose and persistent use, as well as the combination of opioids with potentially addictive medications, stands out as a priority in optimising medicine in Greater Manchester. 

This study focuses on four key research questions:
1. How frequent is the potential problematic opioid use, such as long-term, high-dose use, combining multiple medications with high dependence tendency, in patients with chronic non-cancer pain?
2. What factors are associated with problematic opioid use? For example, patient demographics, socioeconomics, baseline comorbidities, medical history, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for pain control.
3. Whether and how frequently can long-term opioids be tapered, and what factors contribute to successful tapering?
4. How frequently did severe adverse events occur in patients using opioid use? 

We will target adults (aged 18 and above) experiencing chronic pain and receiving more than two opioid prescriptions within 90 days between 2017 and 2023. We will use the Greater Manchester Care Records data, including patient characteristics, practice data, diagnosis data, therapeutic data (medication prescriptions and non-pharmacological treatments), and referral data for hospital treatments. 

Through this investigation, we seek a profound understanding of long-term opioid use patterns in chronic pain patients in Greater Manchester. Our discoveries will illuminate variations in opioid prescribing and associated adverse consequences, particularly in problematic usage. This knowledge will guide interventions and policies to enhance access to pain management options, ultimately minimising health inequalities. Additionally, our research strives to ensure the safe use of medication, improve patients' quality of life, and reduce unnecessary healthcare resource utilisation. In totality, this study is a pivotal step towards achieving more effective and equitable pain management, all while mitigating the risks linked to opioid use.
