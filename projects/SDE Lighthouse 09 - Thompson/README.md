- [Clinical code sets](#clinical-code-sets)

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Create table of patients who were alive at the study start date

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Chronic Pain

SNOMED and Read codes from study team for SDE-LS-006, used in previous CPRD studies.

EMIS and CTV3 codes retrieved from reference lookup in Graphnet database.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `57.8% - 60.6%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### Neuropathic pain

Neuropathic pain is nerve pain that can happen if your nervous system malfunctions or gets damaged. You can feel pain from any of the various levels of your nervous system, including your peripheral nerves, your spinal cord and your brain. Damaged nerve fibers send the wrong signals to pain centers in your body, resulting in neuropathic pain.

#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `9.34% - 10.3%` is perhaps too wide to suggest that this code set is well defined.

### Contraceptives - emergency pills

This code set was based on BNF codes (mapped to SNOMED) starting with 070305, following the approach used in: https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/id/eprint/707403/4/Walker_2022.pdf
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.87% - 2.19%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2022-04-05 | EMIS            | 2662112    |  57642 (2.17%)   |   1019 (0.04%)    |

### Contraceptives - tablet

This code set was based on BNF codes (mapped to SNOMED) starting with 070301, 070302,  following the approach used in https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/id/eprint/707403/4/Walker_2022.pdf. So this code set incorporates all codes in 'progesterone-only' and 'combined-hormonal' code sets, except those related to injections, IUDs or implants, which have been moved into their respective code set (e.g. contraceptives-implant)

NB this code also contains a small number of codes related to transdermal patches and vaginal delivery contraceptives.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `15.8% - 18.1%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### Intrauterine contraceptive device

SNOMED codes retrieved by searching the BNF list for references to 'intrauterine'.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.8% - 2.3%` suggests that this code set is well defined.
