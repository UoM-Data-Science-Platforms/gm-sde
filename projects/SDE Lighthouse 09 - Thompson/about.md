# Investigating the relationship between HRT prescribing and health care utilisation

## Summary

In recent times, and at long last, there's been a lot of discussion in the media about women's health, especially about peri-menopause and menopause. However, there's been little research into how this is affecting the overall healthcare system. Particularly, there hasnâ€™t been much study on the big shift in the use of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) among women, which seems to have been sparked by well-known celebrities like Davina McCall talking about it. We're planning to thoroughly explore how this trend is impacting healthcare in Greater Manchester, looking at both primary care (like visits to the GP) and secondary care (like hospital treatments). We'll be paying special attention to how this varies across different communities in Greater Manchester, as they might have different views on menopause and HRT.
