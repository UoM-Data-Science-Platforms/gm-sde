# Optimising lung cancer screening for individuals from underserved communities within Greater Manchester.

## Summary

Lung cancer is the UK’s leading cause of cancer death. Screening can save lives by finding lung cancer early. However, people at risk of lung cancer are also at risk of dying from other diseases. Understanding who benefits most from screening and whether people with multiple diseases benefit is important.
Screening for lung cancer using low-dose CT scans is being rolled out across Greater Manchester (GM) for smokers at high-risk (called the Targeted Lung Health Check programme). We have shown that more lung cancers are detected by screening. Importantly, most are found at an early stage and can therefore be cured.
In this proposal we want to better understand who is most likely to benefit from screening. One way to do this is to predict how many years of life individuals may gain from lung screening. This is called ‘life years gained’. This is a new approach that has not been examined in real-world screening programmes before. 
The Lighthouse Study provides the opportunity to achieve this by allowing us to have a far greater understanding of the overall health of people being screened, whether they have other diseases (comorbidities), how often they visit hospital and when they die. We will use this data to model and analyse the ‘life-years gained’ approach to risk prediction, and whether it can help us to focus screening on those who stand to benefit most from it.
This research will help us understand the best ways to invite people for screening using existing healthcare records. This is a priority to maximise the benefits of screening, avoid harms, and reduce health inequalities to inform how is rolled out nationally.

## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project did not require any reusable queries from the local library [https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/Reusable queries for data extraction](https://github.com/rw251/gm-idcr/tree/master/shared/Reusable%20queries%20for%20data%20extraction).## Clinical code sets

This project required the following clinical code sets:

- height v1
- weight v1
- myocardial-infarction v1
- angina v1
- tuberculosis v1
- venous-thromboembolism v1
- pneumonia v1
- copd v1
- efi-mobility-problems v1
- efi-vision-problems v1
- lung-cancer v1

Further details for each code set can be found below.

### Height

A patient's height as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`229.. - O/E - Height`).

Codes taken from https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/suppl/2020/05/19/2020.05.14.20101626.DC1/2020.05.14.20101626-1.pdf
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `66.10% - 72.59%` suggests that this code set is well defined.
