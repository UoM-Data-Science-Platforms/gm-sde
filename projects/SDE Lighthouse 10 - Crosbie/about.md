# Optimising lung cancer screening for individuals from underserved communities within Greater Manchester.

## Summary

Lung cancer is the UK’s leading cause of cancer death. Screening can save lives by finding lung cancer early. However, people at risk of lung cancer are also at risk of dying from other diseases. Understanding who benefits most from screening and whether people with multiple diseases benefit is important.
Screening for lung cancer using low-dose CT scans is being rolled out across Greater Manchester (GM) for smokers at high-risk (called the Targeted Lung Health Check programme). We have shown that more lung cancers are detected by screening. Importantly, most are found at an early stage and can therefore be cured.
In this proposal we want to better understand who is most likely to benefit from screening. One way to do this is to predict how many years of life individuals may gain from lung screening. This is called ‘life years gained’. This is a new approach that has not been examined in real-world screening programmes before. 
The Lighthouse Study provides the opportunity to achieve this by allowing us to have a far greater understanding of the overall health of people being screened, whether they have other diseases (comorbidities), how often they visit hospital and when they die. We will use this data to model and analyse the ‘life-years gained’ approach to risk prediction, and whether it can help us to focus screening on those who stand to benefit most from it.
This research will help us understand the best ways to invite people for screening using existing healthcare records. This is a priority to maximise the benefits of screening, avoid harms, and reduce health inequalities to inform how is rolled out nationally.
