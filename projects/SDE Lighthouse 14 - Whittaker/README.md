## Introduction

The aim of this document is to provide full transparency for all parts of the data extraction process.
This includes:

- The methodology around how the data extraction process is managed and quality is maintained.
- A full list of all queries used in the extraction, and their associated objectives and assumptions.
- A full list of all clinical codes used for the extraction.

## Methodology

After each proposal is approved, a Research Data Engineer (RDE) works closely with the research team to establish precisely what data they require and in what format.
The RDE has access to the entire de-identified database and so builds up an expertise as to which projects are feasible and how best to extract the relevant data.
The RDE has access to a library of resusable SQL queries for common tasks, and sets of clinical codes for different phenotypes, built up from previous studies.
Prior to data extraction, the code is checked and signed off by another RDE.

## Reusable queries
  
This project required the following reusable queries:

- Smoking status
- Alcohol Intake
- BMI
- Index Multiple Deprivation
- Lower level super output area
- Sex
- Long-term conditions and comorbidities
- Define Cohort for LH004: patients that had an SLE diagnosis
- Year of birth
- Create table of patients who are registered with a GM GP

Further details for each query can be found below.

### Smoking status
To get the smoking status for each patient in a cohort.

_Assumptions_

- We take the most recent smoking status in a patient's record to be correct
- However, there is likely confusion between the "non smoker" and "never smoked" codes. Especially as sometimes the synonyms for these codes overlap. Therefore, a patient wih a most recent smoking status of "never", but who has previous smoking codes, would be classed as WorstSmokingStatus=non-trivial-smoker / CurrentSmokingStatus=non-smoker

_Input_
```
Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
 #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort
 Also takes one parameter:
	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "RLS.vw_GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, FK_Reference_Coding_ID, and FK_Reference_SnomedCT_ID
```

_Output_
```
A temp table as follows:
 #PatientSmokingStatus (FK_Patient_Link_ID, PassiveSmoker, WorstSmokingStatus, CurrentSmokingStatus)
	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
	- PassiveSmoker - Y/N (whether a patient has ever had a code for passive smoking)
	- WorstSmokingStatus - [non-trivial-smoker/trivial-smoker/non-smoker]
	- CurrentSmokingStatus - [non-trivial-smoker/trivial-smoker/non-smoker]
```

### Cyclophosphamide

A chemotherapy drug.
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. The very low prevalence suggests that this drug is not routinely recorded in primary care.

### ACE Inhibitors

This code set was originally created for the SMASH safe medication dashboard and has been validated in practice.

**_NB this code set is for ACE inhibitors AND angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). If you just want ACEIs please use v2._**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `12.36% - 13.02%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

### SGLT2 inhibitors (gliflozins)

Any prescription of a SGLT2 inhibitor (gliflozin).
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.25% - 1.25%` for EMIS and Vision suggests that this code set is well defined. The figure of `0.90%` for TPP is lower than expected, but TPP have the smallest patient population so a degree of variability is to be expected.

_Update **2023-10-27**: Prevalence is now in the range `2.07% - 2.19%` which suggests this code set is now more consistent._

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `63.96% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.

**UPDATE** By looking at the prevalence of patients with a BMI code that also has a non-zero value the range becomes `62.48% - 64.93%` which suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2023/11/01**: prevalence now `61.2% - 65.7%` for EMIS and VISION. TPP higher at 73%._

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis codes

Developed from https://getset.ga.
This list only includes CKD diagnosis codes (`XaNbn. - Chronic kidney disease stage 3ASerum cholesterol raised`), rather than codes which indicate that a patient might have CKD (`9Ni9.00 - Did not attend chronic kidney disease monitoring clinic`).

Also this includes CKD stages 1-5. Often people only want CKD stages 3-5, in which case use the code sets `ckd-stage-3`, `ckd-stage-4`, and `ckd-stage-5`.

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5

Codes showing a diagnosis of stage 5 CKD. Also includes codes for "end stage renal failure".
#### Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.075% - 0.085%` suggests that this code set is well defined.
