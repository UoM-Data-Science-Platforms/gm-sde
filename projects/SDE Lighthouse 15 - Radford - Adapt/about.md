# ADAPT - improving the long-term management of lymphoma survivors

## Summary

ADAPT is a care pathway for Christie patients which aims to better manage the late treatment toxicities and long-term health risks associated with chemotherapy/radiotherapy in patients cured of lymphoma in a primary care setting. ADAPT aims to reduce the number of patients receiving inappropriate hospital based follow up whilst empowering patients and informing GPs to pro-actively co-manage the risks. This may lead to better outcomes and quality of life for patients, in addition to cost savings for the NHS. We plan to evaluate the cost-consequences of the ADAPT pathway to inform potential roll out across GM.
