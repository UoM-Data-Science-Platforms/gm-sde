Attempted to find the location of information related to project no.1 (Grant), including:
    - patient demographics: ethnicity, sex, DOB, LSOA, Postcode
    - A&E attendance, GP Events
    - Diagnoses codes to identify long-term conditions
    - Covid-19 tests
    - Deceased flag and date

22/10/20 	09:00-12:00
- producing counts from the event table and comparing to other tables such as GP_encounters

- producing aggregate counts for each tenancy to find those that are missing. Several missing for acute

29/10/20 	09:00 - 12:00
- looking for demographics needed for the Bakerly study and creating basic script with those that have been found
- using GP_events to find most recent BMI recording for a cohort of patients

06/11/20 	10:00 - 12:00
- using methotrexate code lists to find secondary care prescribing of this drug, split by trust and month
- noticed that the SNOMED codes aren't featuring in the final table so need to investigate this

18/11/20 	09:30 - 10:00
- checking how much hospital data we have: produced counts of acute data per tenancy, with minimum dates

20/11/20 	09:30 - 12:00
 - investigating covid tests, admissions and discharges for info on patients that got covid whilst in hospital

20/11/20 	13:15 - 14:00
 - checking covid codes to send to graphnet for potential inclusion to covid19 table

25/11/20 09:00 - 09:05
 - documenting some covid codes that do not appear in the covid19 table, to report as a bug

07/12/20 12:15 - 12:30
 - checking potential missing covid codes for Graphnet

06/01/21 13:45 - 14:00
- confirming that the covid codes now appear in the covid19 table

15/01/21 14:35 - 17:00 
- Checking what data we have in relation to studies 14, 16 and 21.

18/01/21 09:30 - 12:00
- investigating procedure data in acute_coding.
- found that only 3 tenancies provide PROC data - Tameside, UHSM and Pennine
- for vent/oxygen data, only UHSM has records, starting from Sept 20.

20/01/21 10:00 - 11:30
- checking minimum dates for each CCG, to create metadata that can be viewed by prospective researchers

26/01/21 13:20 - 16:00
- looking into lab test data for study RQ21 (Bakerly)
- looking into whether admissions can be classified as respiratory or non-resp - we don't have data that specific

27/01/21 09:30 - 10:00
- checking demographics and non-clinical vars for RQ14 (Shi)

27/01/21 10:30 - 12:30
 - looking into radiology data - we have it for 7 trusts but not Trafford and Salford.

28/01/21 09:45 - 11:30
- looking for respiratory sample data in both primary and secondary care, for study 21

28/01/21 15:00 - 16:00
- looking into ventilation data in the GP record - as only two trusts supply it in the acute data

29/01/21 09:25 - 10:25
- further investigations of lab test data

08/02/21 10:25 - 12: 45
- finding field names for acute data and observations - for stage 2a RQ15 (Bakerly)
- answering queries about data from PI for RQ29

08/02/21 16:30 - 16:40 
- checking how far back we can get patient diagnoses in GP Events

10/02/21 15:40 - 15:50
- checking if we can identify remote GP appointments or home visits. this is in progress but not available yet.

12/02/21 14:40 - 16:00
- exploring long-term conditions code for RQ28 (Hassan)

03/03/21
- investigating microbiology and culture data

12/03/21
- writing some example code for lab test ResultNotes which we don't have access to. Will ask Graphnet to run this, to extract useful terms.
- writing code to randomise PatientIDs for each individual study

15/03/21
- designing process for randomising Patient IDs for each study

16/03
- testing randomise ID process

22/03/21
- comparing MFT admissions with other data source

29/03/21
