-- OBJECTIVE: To get the LSOA for each patient.

-- INPUT: Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
-- #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
--  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort

-- OUTPUT: A temp table as follows:
-- #PatientLSOA (FK_Patient_Link_ID, LSOA)
-- 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
--	- LSOA_Code - nationally recognised LSOA identifier

-- ASSUMPTIONS:
--	- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple LSOAs we determine the LSOA as follows:
--	-	If the patients has an LSOA in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
--	-	If every LSOA for a paitent is the same, then we use that
--	-	If there is a single most recently updated LSOA in the database then we use that
--	-	Otherwise the patient's LSOA is considered unknown

-- Get all patients LSOA for the cohort
