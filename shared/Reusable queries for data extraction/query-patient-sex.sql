-- OBJECTIVE: To get the Sex for each patient.

-- INPUT: Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
-- #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
--  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort

-- OUTPUT: A temp table as follows:
-- #PatientSex (FK_Patient_Link_ID, Sex)
-- 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
--	- Sex - M/F

-- ASSUMPTIONS:
--	- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple sexes we determine the sex as follows:
--	-	If the patients has a sex in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
--	-	If every sex for a patient is the same, then we use that
--	-	If there is a single most recently updated sex in the database then we use that
--	-	Otherwise the patient's sex is considered unknown

-- Get all patients sex for the cohort
