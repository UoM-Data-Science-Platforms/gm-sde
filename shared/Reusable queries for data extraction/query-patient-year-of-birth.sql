-- OBJECTIVE: To get the year of birth for each patient.

-- INPUT: Assumes there exists a temp table as follows:
-- #Patients (FK_Patient_Link_ID)
--  A distinct list of FK_Patient_Link_IDs for each patient in the cohort

-- OUTPUT: A temp table as follows:
-- #PatientYearOfBirth (FK_Patient_Link_ID, YearOfBirth)
-- 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
--	- YearOfBirth - INT

-- ASSUMPTIONS:
--	- Patient data is obtained from multiple sources. Where patients have multiple YOBs we determine the YOB as follows:
--	-	If the patients has a YOB in their primary care data feed we use that as most likely to be up to date
--	-	If every YOB for a paient is the same, then we use that
--	-	If there is a single most recently updated YOB in the database then we use that
--	-	Otherwise we take the highest YOB for the patient that is not in the future

-- Get all patients year of birth for the cohort
