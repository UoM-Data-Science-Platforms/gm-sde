-- OBJECTIVE: To get tables of all patients with a COVID diagnosis in their record. This now includes a table
-- that has reinfections. This uses a 90 day cut-off to rule out patients that get multiple tests for
-- a single infection. This 90 day cut-off is also used in the government COVID dashboard. In the first wave,
-- prior to widespread COVID testing, and prior to the correct clinical codes being	available to clinicians,
-- infections were recorded in a variety of ways. We therefore take the first diagnosis from any code indicative
-- of COVID. However, for subsequent infections we insist on the presence of a positive COVID test
-- as opposed to simply a diagnosis code. This is to avoid the situation where a hospital diagnosis code gets 
-- entered into the primary care record several months after the actual infection. NB this does not include antigen (LFT) tests.

-- INPUT: Takes three parameters
--  - start-date: string - (YYYY-MM-DD) the date to count diagnoses from. Usually this should be 2020-01-01.
--	-	all-patients: boolean - (true/false) if true, then all patients are included, otherwise only those in the pre-existing #Patients table.
--	- gp-events-table: string - (table name) the name of the table containing the GP events. Usually is "SharedCare.GP_Events" but can be anything with the columns: FK_Patient_Link_ID, EventDate, and SuppliedCode

-- OUTPUT: Three temp tables as follows:
-- #CovidPatients (FK_Patient_Link_ID, FirstCovidPositiveDate)
-- 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
--	- FirstCovidPositiveDate - earliest COVID diagnosis
-- #CovidPatientsAllDiagnoses (FK_Patient_Link_ID, CovidPositiveDate)
-- 	- FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
--	- CovidPositiveDate - any COVID diagnosis
-- #CovidPatientsMultipleDiagnoses
--	-	FK_Patient_Link_ID - unique patient id
--	-	FirstCovidPositiveDate - date of first COVID diagnosis
--	-	SecondCovidPositiveDate - date of second COVID diagnosis
--	-	ThirdCovidPositiveDate - date of third COVID diagnosis
--	-	FourthCovidPositiveDate - date of fourth COVID diagnosis
--	-	FifthCovidPositiveDate - date of fifth COVID diagnosis
