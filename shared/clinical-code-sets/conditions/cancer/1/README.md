ICD10 codes have been provided and verified by the Christie team (004). 

## Prevalence log
By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set, as of 19th July 2021.
