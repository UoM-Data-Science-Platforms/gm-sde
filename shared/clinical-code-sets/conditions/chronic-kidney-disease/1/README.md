# Chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis codes

Developed from https://getset.ga.
This list only includes CKD diagnosis codes (`XaNbn. - Chronic kidney disease stage 3ASerum cholesterol raised`), rather than codes which indicate that a patient might have CKD (`9Ni9.00 - Did not attend chronic kidney disease monitoring clinic`).

Also this includes CKD stages 1-5. Often people only want CKD stages 3-5, in which case use the code sets `ckd-stage-3`, `ckd-stage-4`, and `ckd-stage-5`.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `3.18% - 4.30%` suggests that this code set is well defined.
