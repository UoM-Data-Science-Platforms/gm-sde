# Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3

Codes showing a diagnosis of stage 3 CKD.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `2.9% - 3.2%` for EMIS and Vision suggests that this code set is well defined. TPP practices are a bit higher at `4.3%` which may be down to the way CKD is recorded there.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2023-10-31 | EMIS            | 2472595    |    72486 (2.93%) |     72556 (2.93%) |
