Any suggestion of a diagnosis of COPD.

This code set is a subset of version 1. The difference here is that 'emphysema' and 'chronic bronchitis' have been separated into their own code sets.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `2.11% - 2.47%` in 2023 suggests that this code set is well defined.
