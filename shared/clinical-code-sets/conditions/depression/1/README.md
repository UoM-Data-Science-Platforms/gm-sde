# Depression

Code set for patients with a diagnosis of depression.

Developed from www.opencodelists.org

- No "affective disorder" codes unless mention of depression e.g. 191632009: Bipolar affective disorder, currently depressed, severe, with psychosis (disorder)
- Seasonal affective disorder included as that is a depressive condition
- Includes non-diagnosis codes such as monitoring invites
- Codes indicating grief from bereavement or other life events are included on the grounds that if they are coded in a person's record they are likely clinically important

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system,
we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.
Prevalence range: 21.09% - 22.83%
