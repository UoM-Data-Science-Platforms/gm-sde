# Genital tract infections

Infections of the male or female upper genital tract. Including pelvic inflammatory disease, salpingitis, endometritis, oophritis, cervicitis, epididymitis, orchitis, prostatitis. Excluding superficial infections e.g. vulvovaginitis, balanitis.

This code set was created from a Readv2 code set developed from the University of Bristol:

Jessica Watson (2018): CPRD codes: infections and autoimmune diseases. https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.2954m5h0ync672u8yzx16xxj7l

It was then mapped to EMIS, CTV3 and SNOMED, and supplemented with codes from a traversal of the SNOMED hierarchy.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `7.3 - 8.5%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2024-07-09 | EMIS            | 2533608    |   215633 (8.51%) |    215616 (8.51%) |
| 2024-07-09 | TPP             | 201974     |    14831 (7.34%) |     14831 (7.34%) |
| 2024-07-09 | Vision          | 335755     |    26957 (8.03%) |     26902 (8.01%) |

Puerpural infections
An infection associated with pregnancy, the puerperium or lactation (including mastitis, endometritis, puerperal sepsis).
Cardiovascular
Definition: infection of the tissues of the heart, including endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, regardless of infectious organism
Neurological
Infections of the central nervous system (brain, meninges, spinal cord) regardless of causative organism. Including meningitis, encephalitis and cranial abscess.  
Peritonitis
Peritonitis is defined as inflammation of the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity includes an extensive serous membrane that covers the entire abdominal wall and is reflected over the contained viscera, the greater and lesser omentum, and the transverse mesocolon. (GP notebook)

Autoimmune diseases

Autoimmune disease
Definition
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease [NICE, 2009a]. RA typically presents as inflammatory arthritis affecting the small joints of the hands and the feet, although any synovial joint can be involved. As RA progresses, any system of the body may be affected. For this definition also include seropositive arthritis such as Still’s disease or juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Seronegative arthritis
Any other inflammatory arthritis of likely autoimmune origin, including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (‘lupus’)
Systemic lupus erythematosus is the classic prototype of a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory connective tissue disorder of autoimmune origin. It often follows a relapsing and remitting pattern the disease is characterised by the presence of a wide spectrum of autoantibodies.
Autoimmune vasculitis
The vasculitides are a range of disorders in which the primary pathological process is inflammation of blood vessels. For this code we want to include all vasculitides which are likely to have autoimmune aetiology, regardless of size of blood vessels/subtype. Includes Wegener’s granulomatosis, churg-strauss, allergic granulomatosis, Kawasaki, polyarteritis nodosa, Bechet’s, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, necrotising arteritis, necrotising polyangiitis, chronic granulomatous arteritis, takayasu’s arteritis.
Polymyalgia rheumatica / temporal arteritis (‘polymyalgia’)
Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory condition of unknown cause, characterized by aching and morning stiffness in the neck, shoulder, and pelvic girdle. Giant cell arteritis and its complications can occur, abruptly and without warning, early in the course of polymyalgia rheumatica.  
Autoimmune myopathies
(‘dermatomyositis’)
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are systemic connective tissue diseases which are characterised by acute and chronic inflammation of striated muscle. In dermatomyositis, there is an accompanying dermatitis.
Scleroderma
Systemic sclerosis is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue diseases which are characterised by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs.
Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by the accumulation of non-caseating epithelioid granulomas in involved organs
Inflammatory bowel disease
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are collectively known as 'inflammatory bowel disease'. Sometimes it is not possible to determine if the person has ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, in which case they are said to have 'indeterminate' colitis.
Cardiovascular
Any disease of the heart; myocardium, pericardium, or heart valves of likely autoimmune aetiology including rheumatic heart disease, autoimmune cardiomyopathy, autoimmune myocarditis
Type 1 diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders in which persistent hyperglycaemia (random plasma glucose more than 11 mmol/L) is caused by deficient insulin secretion, resistance to the action of insulin, or both. Type 1 diabetes — an absolute insulin deficiency causes persistent hyperglycaemia (insulin activity is normal). The term 'type 1 diabetes' has replaced the older terms 'insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)' and 'juvenile-onset diabetes'.
Haematological
Any haematological condition of likely autoimmune origin, This includes: Pernicious anaemia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (warm type autoantibodies/cold type), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura/immune thrombocytopenia ITP, antiphospholipid syndrome, immune neutropenia, acquired aplastic anaemia, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria PNH, acquired haemophilia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, cold agglutin disease
Addison’s
Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) is a result of autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex. Adrenal insufficiency may also be caused by long-term administration of corticosteroids or disorders of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, but this is not Addison's disease. We are interested in autoimmune Addison's, not distruction of the adrenal cortex due to infection (eg TB) or other causes.  
Primary adrenocortical insufficiency
Addison disease
Autoimmune adrenalitis
Also including autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes
Hepatobiliary (‘liver’)
Including: autoimmune conditions of the liver or biliary tree include primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune cholangitis and autoimmune pancreatitis (no codes found for latter). Definitions (GP Notebook): Chronic autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic hepatitis of unknown origin that predominantly affects young and middle-aged women. It is associated with HLA types A1, B8, DR3 and Dw3. Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease characterised by chronic, progressive, destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in chronic cholestasis, portal inflammation, and fibrosis which will eventually lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare disease of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the bile duct. Narrowing of the bile duct lumen usually occurs throughout the biliary tree. There is a strong association with inflammatory bowel disease (75 per cent of cases), particularly ulcerative colitis but also Crohn’s disease.
Skin
Including pemphigus and pemphigoid.
Renal
Any renal disease of likely autoimmune aetiology. Includes anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM), SLE nephritis, ANCA vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, IgA nephropathy/Berger’s disease,
Respiratory
Any respiratory disease of likely autoimmune aetiology, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cryptogenic organising pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans
