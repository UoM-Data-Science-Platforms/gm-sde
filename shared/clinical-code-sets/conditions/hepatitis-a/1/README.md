# Hepatitis A

Any code indicating that a patient has hepatitis A.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.11% - 0.13%` for EMIS and Vision is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined. TPP is a lot lower, but possibly due to the coding of hepatitis often being non-specific (e.g. XaYbp - Viral hepatitis with hepatic coma).

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2024-07-16 | EMIS            | 2696332    |    4432 (0.164%) |     3016 (0.112%) |
| 2024-07-16 | TPP             | 215597     |    135 (0.0626%) |      32 (0.0148%) |
