# HIV

Codes indicating a diagnosis of HIV. Snomed and CTV3 codelist are from the [OpenSafely project](https://codelists.opensafely.org/codelist/opensafely/hiv/2020-07-13/#full-list). The Read 2 codelist is from the LSHTM Data Compass.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.010% - 0.029%` is perhaps a bit wide, but as the numbers are so low it is likely well-defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
