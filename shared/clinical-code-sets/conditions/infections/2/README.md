# Infections

Any code indicating an infection. Created as the union of the following code sets:

- bone-infection (v1)
- cardiovascular-infection (v1)
- cellulitis (v1)
- diverticulitis (v1)
- gastrointestinal-infections (v1)
- genital-tract-infections (v1)
- hepatobiliary-infection (v1)
- infection-other (v1)
- lrti (v1)
- muscle-infection (v1)
- neurological-infection (v1)
- peritonitis (v1)
- puerpural-infection (v1)
- pyelonephritis (v1)
- urti-bacterial (v1)
- urti-viral (v1)
- uti (v2)

Each of which was derived from a Readv2 code set developed from the University of Bristol:

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `74% - 80.1%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2024-07-10 | EMIS            | 2533608    |  1880834 (74.2%) |     1873816 (74%) |
| 2024-07-10 | TPP             | 201974     |   162093 (80.3%) |    161814 (80.1%) |
| 2024-07-10 | Vision          | 335755     |   254065 (75.7%) |    252991 (75.3%) |
