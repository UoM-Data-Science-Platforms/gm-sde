# Neuropathic pain

Neuropathic pain is nerve pain that can happen if your nervous system malfunctions or gets damaged. You can feel pain from any of the various levels of your nervous system, including your peripheral nerves, your spinal cord and your brain. Damaged nerve fibers send the wrong signals to pain centers in your body, resulting in neuropathic pain.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `9.34% - 10.3%` is perhaps too wide to suggest that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2024-04-10 | EMIS | 2528955 | 236155 (9.34%) | 236110 (9.34%) | 
| 2024-04-10 | TPP | 201791 | 20713 (10.3%) | 20721 (10.3%) |
