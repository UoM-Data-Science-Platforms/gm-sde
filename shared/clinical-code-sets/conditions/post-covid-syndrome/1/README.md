This code set has been superseded by the following code sets:

- [long-covid-diagnosis](../../long-covid-diagnosis/1/)
- [long-covid-assessment](../../../patient/long-covid-assessment/1/)
- [long-covid-referral](../../../patient/long-covid-referral/1/)

~~Any code indicating a diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome (aka long COVID). There are also code sets for:~~

~~- Post-COVID referral~~
~~- Post-COVID assessment~~

~~Codes obtained from OPENSafely, in turn from the NICE guidance.~~

~~## Prevalence log~~

~~By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.01% - 0.37%` suggests that this code set is not well defined. We are clearly not capturing these codes from TPP practices. However, the majority of patients (>80%) in GM are at EMIS practices.~~

~~| Date | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |~~
~~| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |~~
~~| 2022-12-02 | EMIS | 2437477 | 8902 (0.365%) | 8909 (0.366%) |~~
~~| 2022-12-02 | TPP | 198613 | 21 (0.0106%) | 21 (0.0106%) |~~
~~| 2022-12-02 | Vision | 327022 | 650 (0.199%) | 650 (0.199%) |~~
