# Schizophrenia and Psychosis

Code set for patients with a diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia. This code set (v2) is a fairly strict definition of psychosis/schizophrenia and ignores codes relating to drug-induced/alcohol-induced psychosis. For a wider definition please use v1.

Developed from https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/phenotypes/PH673/version/1346/detail/ and reviewed by a clinician.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions.
Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range (1.10% - 1.90%)
