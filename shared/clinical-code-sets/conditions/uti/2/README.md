# Urinary tract infection (UTI)

Bacterial infections of the lower urinary tract including urethra, bladder or ureters, excluding pyelonephritis (see separate code set). Excluding chlamydial and gonococcal urethritis and asymptomatic bacteriuria.

This code set was created from a Readv2 code set developed from the University of Bristol:

Jessica Watson (2018): CPRD codes: infections and autoimmune diseases. https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.2954m5h0ync672u8yzx16xxj7l

It was then mapped to EMIS, CTV3 and SNOMED, and supplemented with codes from a traversal of the SNOMED hierarchy.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `19.8 - 21.8%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2024-07-12 | EMIS            | 2695312    |   535660 (19.9%) |    534987 (19.8%) |
| 2024-07-12 | TPP             | 215330     |    46923 (21.8%) |     46873 (21.8%) |
| 2024-07-12 | Vision          | 350931     |    72881 (20.8%) |     72568 (20.7%) |
