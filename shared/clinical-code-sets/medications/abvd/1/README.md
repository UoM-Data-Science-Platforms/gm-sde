# ABVD - first line treatment for Hodgkins Lymphoma

ABVD isÂ a cancer drug combination. It is a treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. There are SNOMED codes for the ABVD chemotherapy protocol, but it's probably better to use the component code sets:

- [Doxorubicin (was **A**driamycin)](../../doxorubicin/1)
- [**B**leomycin](../../bleomycin/1)
- [**V**inblastine](../../vinblastine/1)
- [**D**acarbazine](../../dacarbazine/1)

**_NB These drugs do not currently routinely appear in primary care records._**
