Any code for a prescription of an ACE Inhibitor.

**_NB This does not include ARBs. Please use v1 of this code set for a combined ACEI/ARB code set_**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `11.00% - 11.82%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2023-12-14**: Prevalence now 11% in both EMIS and Vision practices, with TPP slightly higher at 13.8%, possibly reflecting a population with higher prevalence_
