# ACE Inhibitors 

The snomed codes from the NHS refsets (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) were used to build this code set. 

**_NB this code set is for ACE inhibitors AND angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). If you just want ACEIs please use v2._**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `12.4% - 15.4%` suggests that this code set is well defined.
