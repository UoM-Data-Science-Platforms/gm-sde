Getset was also used to identify codes, using the search terms above.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. 

Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `%0.19 - 0.54%` suggests overreporting from TPP and a potential lack of codes across all systems.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
