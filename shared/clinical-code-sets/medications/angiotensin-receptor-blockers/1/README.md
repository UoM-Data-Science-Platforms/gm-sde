Any code for a prescription of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

**_NB This does not include ACEIs. Please use v1 of the ACEI code set for a combined ACEI/ARB code set_**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `4.43% - 4.80%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2023-13/14**: Prevalence remains around 4.5% in Vision and EMIS practices. Prevalence in TPP practices slightly higher at 5.6%, possibly reflecting a population with higher prevalence_
