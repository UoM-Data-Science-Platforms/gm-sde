# Bisphosphonates (osteoporosis and other bone metabolism drugs)

Code set for prescriptions of bisphosphonates.

Developed using a mapping from prod codes to bnf, then mapped to SNOMED.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. 
Here is a log for this code set. The low prevalence for TPP suggests that there are Readv2 codes missing.


| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-05-06 | EMIS            | 2662112    |   149211 (5.60%) |    147870 (5.55%) |
| 2021-05-06 | TPP             | 212726     |     3423 (1.61%) |      3416 (1.61%) |
