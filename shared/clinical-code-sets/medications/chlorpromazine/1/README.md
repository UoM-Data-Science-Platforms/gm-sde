# Chlorpromazine

Any prescription of Chlorpromazine. Other names: Chloractil/Chlorazin/Dozine/Largactil.

Dozine is included as it appears as a descendant of Chlorpromazine Hydrocholride in the Readv2 and CTV3 dictionaries. However, it has been discontinued for so long that it does not appear online and so is not currently verified as a source of Chlorpromazine.

This code set does not include Chlorpromazine in forms exclusively used to combat nausea, or for use in anaesthesia.

Code set created by searching the SNOMED, CTV3 and Readv2 hierarchies for the main name and the brand equivalents, then mapped to EMIS codes.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.20% - 0.29%` suggests that this code set is well defined.
