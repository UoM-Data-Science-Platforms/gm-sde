## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.18% - 0.31%` is possibly not sufficiently narrow to guarantee that this code set is well defined. However EMIS and TPP are very similar. There may be missing codes used by the Vision practices, or a skewed population which lead to a bias whereby the GM Vision practices prescribe this drug less frequently.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
