## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.04% - 1.5%` suggests that this code set is not well defined. However closer analysis shows that the relatively high number of prescriptions from Vision practices occurred prior to 2010. When filtering to just prescriptions since 2010 we find a prevalence range of `0.002% - 0.008*` suggesting well defined but not prescribed any more in uk primary care.
