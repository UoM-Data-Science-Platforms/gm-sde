# Contraceptives - tablet

This code set was based on BNF codes (mapped to SNOMED) starting with 070301, 070302,  following the approach used in https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/id/eprint/707403/4/Walker_2022.pdf. So this code set incorporates all codes in 'progesterone-only' and 'combined-hormonal' code sets, except those related to injections, IUDs or implants, which have been moved into their respective code set (e.g. contraceptives-implant)

NB this code also contains a small number of codes related to transdermal patches and vaginal delivery contraceptives.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `15.8% - 18.1%` suggests that this code set is well defined.
