# Drowsy medications: Benzodiazepines, z-drugs and sedating antihistamines

This code set was created from a list of CPRD codes provided by the PI for LH-003. This file was originally from: https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/178/codelist/res178-benzodiazepine-z-drugs-and-sedating-antihistamine/

These medications have been grouped as they all have drowsy/sedative effects **CHECK WITH PI


## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `4.48 - 19.4%` suggests an issue with codes from TPP practices. This may also be due to variation in how practices prescribe over the counter meds like hayfever meds, sleeping pills etc vs telling you to just buy it in a pharmacy.
