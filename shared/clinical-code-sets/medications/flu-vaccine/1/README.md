# Flu vaccine

Any code for the actual vaccine product. **NB it does not include codes for the flu vaccination procedure - see the `flu-vaccination` code set**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `2.66% - 9.85%` suggests that this code set should be used alongside flu-vaccination.
