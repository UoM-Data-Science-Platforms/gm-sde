## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.14% - 0.19%` suggests that this code set is well defined. Though the Vision practices are perhaps slighly on the low side, though this could be due to the small numbers.
