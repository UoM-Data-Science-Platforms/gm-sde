# Hydroxychloroquine

Any prescription of hydroxychloroquine. Other names: Quinoric/Hydrochloroquine/Plaquenil.

This code set originally created by identifying the relevant codes in the BNF files. The BNF codes are then mapped to SNOMED, and then on to EMIS, Readv2 and CTV3. Subsequently extended by searching the SNOMED, CTV3 and Readv2 hierarchies for the main name and the brand equivalents, then mapped to EMIS codes.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.46% - 0.62%` suggests this is probably well defined.
