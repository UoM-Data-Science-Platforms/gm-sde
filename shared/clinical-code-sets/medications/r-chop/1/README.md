# R-CHOP

R-CHOP isÂ a cancer drug combination. There are SNOMED codes for the R-CHOP chemotherapy protocol, but it's probably better to use the component code sets:

- [**R**ituximab](../../rituximab/1)
- [**C**yclophosphamide](../../cyclophosphamide/1)
- [Doxorubicin **H**ydrochloride](../../doxorubicin/1)
- [Vincristine (was **O**ncovin)](../../vincristine/1)
- [**P**rednisolone (Oral)](../../prednisolone-oral/1)

**_NB These drugs (with the exception of prednisolone) do not currently routinely appear in primary care records._**
