Code set created by searching the SNOMED, CTV3 and Readv2 hierarchies for the main name and the brand equivalents, then mapped to EMIS codes.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.0002% - 0.0015%` is possibly not sufficiently narrow to guarantee that this code set is well defined. However this is very likely due to the very small numbers, which also suggest that this is not used in UK general practice.
