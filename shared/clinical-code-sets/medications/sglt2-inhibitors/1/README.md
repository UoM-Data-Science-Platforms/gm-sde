Any prescription of a SGLT2 inhibitor (gliflozin).

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `1.25% - 1.25%` for EMIS and Vision suggests that this code set is well defined. The figure of `0.90%` for TPP is lower than expected, but TPP have the smallest patient population so a degree of variability is to be expected.

_Update **2023-10-27**: Prevalence is now in the range `2.07% - 2.19%` which suggests this code set is now more consistent._
