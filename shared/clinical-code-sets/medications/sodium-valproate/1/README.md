# Sodium valproate

Category: "mood-stabilizers".

Any prescription of sodium valproate. NB this does not include Valproate Semisodium which is a combination of sodium valproate and valproic acid. Depending on the usage you may need to use that code set as well. Other names include: Depakin/Dyzantil/Epilim/Episenta/Epival/Orlept.

This code set has been autogenerated by identifying the relevant codes in the BNF files. The BNF codes are then mapped to SNOMED, and then on to EMIS, Readv2 and CTV3. Finally the SNOMED hierarchy is traversed to find any extra codes.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.63% - 0.66%` suggests that this code set is well defined.
