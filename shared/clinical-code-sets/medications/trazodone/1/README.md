## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. The prevalence range `0.7% - 1.2%` suggests this is well defined, but with TPP practices having an elevated level of prescribing in this area.
