# Tryptophan

Any prescription of Tryptophan as an antidepressant. Other names: Optimax/Pacitron.

Does not include Kabiven, Oliclinomel or Nutriflex infusions as although these contain tryptophan, they are designed for feeding via IV rather than for depression. Code set created from SNOMED searches and then mapped to Read v2, CTV3 and EMIS.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.004% - 0.005%` suggests that this code set is well defined, but virtually unused in UK primary care.
