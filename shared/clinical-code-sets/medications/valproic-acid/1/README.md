# Valproic acid

Category: "mood-stabilizers".

Any prescription of valproic acid. Other names include: Convulex. NB this does not include Valproate Semisodium (a combination of valproic acid and sodium valproate) and if that is required it should be obtained from the specific code set.

This code set has been autogenerated by identifying the relevant codes in the BNF files. The BNF codes are then mapped to SNOMED, and then on to EMIS, Readv2 and CTV3.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.01% - 0.01%` suggests that this code set is well defined.

_Update **2024-03-27**: Prevalence now 0.07% - 0.08%_
