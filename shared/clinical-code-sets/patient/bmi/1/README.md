# Body Mass Index (BMI)

Any indication that a BMI has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`).

BMI codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a BMI has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's BMI then this is not the code set for you.**
