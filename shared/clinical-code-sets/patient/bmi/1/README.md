# Body Mass Index (BMI)

Any indication that a BMI has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`).

BMI codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a BMI has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's BMI then this is not the code set for you.**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `64.05% - 79.69%` suggests that this code set is perhaps not well defined. However, as EMIS (80% of practices) and TPP (10% of practices) are close, it could simply be down to Vision automatically recording BMIs and therefore increasing the prevalence there.
