# Body Mass Index (BMI)

A patient's BMI as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`22K.. - Body Mass Index`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`22K6. - Body mass index less than 20`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's BMI. If you need to know whether a BMI was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
