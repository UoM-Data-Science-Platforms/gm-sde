# Dental problem

Any code indicating a dental diagnosis or dental issue. This code set is likely only useful for RQ042 as it is not very specific and includes everything from dental diagnoses, to symptoms such as tooth ache, to issues with dental restoration work.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `5.00% - 6.22%` when searching by ID and `6.04% - 6.96%` when searching by code, suggests that this code set is well defined.
