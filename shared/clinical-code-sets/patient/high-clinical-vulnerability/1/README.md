# At high risk of complications with COVID-19

These codes were used by system suppliers to indicate whether a patient was at high risk of complications if contracting COVID-19. EMIS practices originally used the code "9d44. - Risk of exposure to communicable disease (situation)" until they were able to use the SNOMED codes.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filtered through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `5.78% - 6.18%` is sufficiently narrow that this code set is likely well defined - but only when using the supplied clinical codes.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| 2021-03-11 | EMIS            | 2600658    |   158791 (6.11%) |    160665 (6.18%) |
