## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. The prevalence range `0.06% - 0.11%` suggests this codeset is likely well defined, but that it is a code not in frequent usage.
