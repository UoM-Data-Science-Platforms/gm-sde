# Long COVID assessment

Any code indicating an assessment of long-covid / post-covid syndrome. There are also code sets for [long-covid-diagnosis](../../../conditions/long-covid-diagnosis/) and [long-covid-referral](../../long-covid-referral/).

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.0% - 0.007%` suggests missing codes from all practices. However, there is literature showing that all long covid codes are poorly used (https://doi.org/10.3399%2FBJGP.2021.0301 and https://www.adruk.org/fileadmin/uploads/adruk/Documents/Data_Insights/Clinical_coding_and_capture_of_Long_COVID_V.3__4_.pdf). So this is probably lack of use rather than missing codes.
