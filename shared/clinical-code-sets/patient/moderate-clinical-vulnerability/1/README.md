# At moderate risk of complications with COVID-19

These codes were used by system suppliers to indicate whether a patient was at moderate risk of complications if contracting COVID-19.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set.

The discrepancy between the patients counted when using the IDs vs using the clinical codes is due to these being new codes which haven't all filter through to the main Graphnet dictionary. The prevalence range `0.01% - 1.25%` is too wide so these codes are not sufficiently well recorded in practice. Also the figure of `1.25%` is far lower than the actual figure is expected to be from public data.
