# Post-COVID syndrome referral (long COVID)

Any code indicating a referral of a patient with post-COVID syndrome (aka long COVID). There are also code sets for:

- Post-COVID syndrome (diagnosis)
- Post-COVID assessment

Codes obtained from OPENSafely, in turn from the NICE guidance.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.01% - 0.73%` suggests that this code set is not well defined. We are clearly not capturing these codes from TPP practices. However, the majority of patients (>80%) in GM are at EMIS practices.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
