## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `0.05% - 0.30%` suggests potential over reporting from EMIS.

NOTE: Use the IDs rather than codes for this code set. One of the codes (635..) seems to relate to any stage of maturity, not just pre-term
