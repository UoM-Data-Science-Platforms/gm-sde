# Smoking status

Any indication that a smoking status has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's smoking status (`1378. - Ex-light smoker (1-9/day)`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`137.. - Tobacco consumption`).

Smoking status codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a smoking status has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's smoking status then this is not the code set for you.**
