# Flu vaccination

Any code that indicate that a person is eligible for a flu jab. This could be the medical product, the procedure, or administration codes related to the vaccination. It should be noted that the criteria has changed over time. Also certain people are only temporarily eligible for the vaccine e.g. pregnant women, so the presence of a code means the person has at some point been eligible, but aren't necessarily still eligible.

Codes for flu vaccines - the medication itself rather than the procedure for CTV3 and Read v2 code sets are taken as the code `n47.. INFLUENZA VACCINES` and all descendants. For SNOMED these are taken from the NHS dm+d dictionary.

**This code set has not been validated**
