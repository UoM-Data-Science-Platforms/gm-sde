# Blood pressure

Any indication that a blood pressure has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's BP (`2462. - O/E - BP reading low`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`2469. - O/E - Systolic BP reading`).

Blood pressure codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a blood pressure has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's systolic or diastolic blood pressure then this is not the code set for you.**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `64.46% - 67.00%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.
