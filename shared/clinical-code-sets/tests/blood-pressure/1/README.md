# Blood pressure

Any indication that a blood pressure has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's BMI (`2462. - O/E - BP reading low`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`2469. - O/E - Systolic BP reading`).

Blood pressure codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a blood pressure has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's systolic or diastolic blood pressure then this is not the code set for you.**
