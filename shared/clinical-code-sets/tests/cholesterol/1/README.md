# Cholesterol

Any indication that a cholesterol measurement has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's cholesterol (`44P3. - Serum cholesterol raised`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`44P.. Serum cholesterol`).

Cholesterol codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a cholesterol measurement has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's LDL or HDL then this is not the code set for you.**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `44.49% - 49.56%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.
