# Cholesterol

Any indication that a cholesterol measurement has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's cholesterol (`44P3. - Serum cholesterol raised`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`44P.. Serum cholesterol`).

Cholesterol codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a cholesterol measurement has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's LDL or HDL then this is not the code set for you.**
