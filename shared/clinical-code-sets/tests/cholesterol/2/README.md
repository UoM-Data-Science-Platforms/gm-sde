# Cholesterol

A patient's total cholesterol as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`44P.. Serum cholesterol`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`44P3. - Serum cholesterol raised`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's total cholesterol. If you need to know whether a cholesterol was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
