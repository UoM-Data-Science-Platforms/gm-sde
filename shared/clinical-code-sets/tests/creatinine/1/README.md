# Creatinine (level)

A patient's creatinine level as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`44J3.00 - Serum creatinine`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's creatinine (`44J3300 - Serum creatinine raised') without giving the actual value.

Codes taken from: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/suppl/2020/05/19/2020.05.14.20101626.DC1/2020.05.14.20101626-1.pdf

## Prevalence log

**TABLE BELOW NEEDS UPDATING

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `4.91% - 6.24%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.

| Date       | Practice system | Population | Patients from ID | Patient from code |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------: | ----------------: |
