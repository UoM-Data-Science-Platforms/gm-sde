# Ferritin

A patient's ferritin as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`XaItW - Plasma ferritin level`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's ferritin without giving the actual value.

Ferritin codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to only indicate a patient's ferritin values.**

## Prevalence log
By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `33.38% - 39.65%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.
