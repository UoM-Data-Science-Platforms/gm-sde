# Follicle Stimulating Hormone (level)

A patient's follicle stimulating hormone level as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`443i. - Plasma FSH level`).

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `10.55% - 12.17%` suggests that there are perhaps Readv2 codes missing (lower TPP prevalence).
