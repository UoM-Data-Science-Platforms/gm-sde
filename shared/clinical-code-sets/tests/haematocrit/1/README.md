# Haematocrit

A patient's haematocrit percentage as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`XE2Zq - Haematocrit - PCV level`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's haematocrit (`4253 - Haematocrit - PCV - high`) without giving the actual value.

Haematocrit codes were retrieved from https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/suppl/2020/05/19/2020.05.14.20101626.DC1/2020.05.14.20101626-1.pdf.

**NB: This code set is intended to only indicate a patient's haematocrit percentage**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `57.2% - 65.6%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.
