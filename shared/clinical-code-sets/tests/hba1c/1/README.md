# HbA1c

Any indication that a HbA1c has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's BMI (`165679005 - Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than 7%`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`1003671000000109 - Haemoglobin A1c level`).

HbA1c codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a HbA1c has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's HbA1c then this is not the code set for you.**

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `44.92% - 50.88%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.
