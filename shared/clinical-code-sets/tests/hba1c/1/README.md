# HbA1c

Any indication that a HbA1c has been recorded for a patient. This code set includes codes that indicates a patient's BMI (`165679005 - Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than 7%`), as well as codes that are accompanied by a value (`1003671000000109 - Haemoglobin A1c level`).

HbA1c codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate whether a HbA1c has been recorded, NOT what the value was. If you require a patient's HbA1c then this is not the code set for you.**
