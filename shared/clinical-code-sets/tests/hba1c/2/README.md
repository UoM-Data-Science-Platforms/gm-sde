# HbA1c

A patient's HbA1c as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`1003671000000109 - Haemoglobin A1c level`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`165679005 - Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than 7%`) without giving the actual value.

**NB: This code set is intended to indicate a patient's HbA1c. If you need to know whether a HbA1c was recorded then please use v1 of the code set.**
