# Systolic Blood pressure

Any indication that systolic blood pressure has been recorded for a patient. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`2469. - O/E - Systolic BP reading`).

Blood pressure codes retrieved from [GetSet](https://getset.ga) and metadata available in this directory.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `64.46% - 67.00%` suggests that this code set is likely well defined.

_Update **2023/11/01**: prevalence now `64.7% - 65.4%` for EMIS and VISION. TPP higher at 71.6%._
