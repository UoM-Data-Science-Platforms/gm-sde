# Testosterone (level)

A patient's testosterone level as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`4473.00 - Serum testosterone`). It does not include codes that indicate a patient's BMI (`4473100 - Serum testosterone level abnormal`) without giving the actual value.
