# Urinary Albmin Creatinine Ratio

A patient's urinary albumin creatinine ratio as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value. It does not include codes that indicate a patient's ratio without giving the actual value.

## Prevalence log

By examining the prevalence of codes (number of patients with the code in their record) broken down by clinical system, we can attempt to validate the clinical code sets and the reporting of the conditions. Here is a log for this code set. The prevalence range `10.91% - 14.61%` is possibly not sufficiently narrow to guarantee that this code set is well defined.
