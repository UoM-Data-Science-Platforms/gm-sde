# Vitamin D

A patient's vitamin D level as recorded via clinical code and value. This code set only includes codes that are accompanied by a value (`44P6.00 - Serum LDL cholesterol level`). This only includes codes for total vitamin D level and does not use codes that measure a patient's D2 or D3 levels.
